Thomas Schneider tackles 101 questions about ancient Egypt, loosely organized into thematic
categories including history, religion, society, and worldview. With a book of this nature, a series of
issues comes to the fore: what drives the selection of questions? How well does it serve its intended
audience, and how widely does it appeal? Does it have uses for a specialist reader as a reference or as
a teaching tool?
The intended audience and selection of questions are briefly addressed in the author’s preface, in
which Schneider states that the volume aims to “introduce readers to ancient Egypt and invite them
to further study” (p. xiii). Questions were chosen for the frequency with which they are asked or their
potential to provide intriguing and provocative insights into ancient Egypt (ibid.). The resulting mix
is quite variable in scope, and the appeal of the question-and-answer format depends largely on each
reader’s purpose in approaching the book. Some of the 101 questions will resonate with faculty who
have heard their own students, from across disciplines and backgrounds, ask variations of these queries:
Is there anything left to discover in Egypt (questions 20 and 26)? Were Egyptians obsessed with death
(question 22)? And where were Egypt’s cities (question 58)? It can be useful for teachers to reflect
anew on these topics and consider Schneider’s answers as they formulate their own.
Others will sound familiar to any who have written (and subsequently graded) essay questions for
introductory-level Egyptology exams. “Why is the Middle Kingdom considered to be the ‘classical’
period of ancient Egypt?” (question 31) and “What does the phrase ‘grammar of the temple’ mean?”
(question 41) are queries that would likely not occur to a lay audience, though they do seem like a convenient
reference
for
undergraduates
cramming
for
their
midterm
examination.
Scholars
may
well
find

themselves
drawn in by some of the more
unexpected topics, such as Egyptology’s
role
in the Third
Reich
(question
9)
and
the
effect
of
landscape
and
environment
on
culture
change
(question
19).
At
one

to
three
pages each, the answers are
too brief to be of substantial academic use, but they do serve the useful
function
of
suggesting
areas
of
inquiry
and
directing
the
reader
onto
a
path
to
further
investigation.
Several questions will likely be of interest to those who have no background in ancient Egypt but
who wonder about its lasting influence—the pyramid on the American dollar bill, for example (question
3)—or
whether
the
Egyptians
shared
our
view
of
the
cosmos
(question
14).
For
readers
who
have

an
interest
in
comparative
religion
or
who
may
have
faith-based
questions,
Schneider
addresses
ancient

Egypt’s
intersection
with
Judaism
(question
5),
Mormonism
(question
6),
the
Messiah
(question
37),

and
the
early
rivalry
between
Christianity
and
pre-Christian
Egyptian
religion
(question
7).
The volume’s strongest entries are those that address fundamental issues in Egyptology or provide
a window into a larger and fascinating aspect of society. Questions such as “When did ancient Egypt’s 
history begin?” (question 23) and “When did ancient Egypt end?” (question 24) are deceptively tricky, 
as any instructor designing an introductory Egyptian history course has discovered. Where to begin the
story of ancient Egypt and where to end it are matters of debate, and Schneider provides a balanced
and reasoned argument to carry our consideration of ancient Egypt into the late fourth century

An unexpected question can result in an insightful commentary on Egyptian practice and worldview.
Schneider
describes the cultural context of the color spectrum by asking how the Egyptians

described
the
color
of
the
sea
(question
16).
In
another
interesting
window
into
society,
he
elaborates

on
the
roles
of
flowers
and
fragrance
in
both
religious
and
literary
contexts
(question
49).
Attention
to

such
ephemeral
features
of
everyday
life
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
usual
topics
of
mummies,
tombs,

and
temples.
Of
the
thematically
organized
chapters,
the
most
successful—in
terms
of
cohesiveness,

accessibility
to
a
non-specialist
audience,
and
usefulness
as
a
reference—is
chapter
6,
“Egyptian
Language
and
Literature.”
Schneider
handles
difficult
subject
matter
with
a
concise
approach,
outlining
the

variety
of
languages
and
dialects
that
were
spoken
in
ancient
Egypt
and
asking
whether
any
lingering

traces
remain.
He
asks
a
striking
question—could
Hetepheres,
Nefertiti,
and
Cleopatra
have
conversed

with
each
other
(question
69)—that
provides
an
opportunity
to
explain
linguistic
change
over
time.
A valuable aspect of this volume lies in those questions that resist an easy answer and will always 
be up for debate. Issues such as the most decisive turning point in Egyptian history (question 28), 
the most significant religious concept (question 39), and the most important architectural monument
and recent excavation (questions 55 and 56) would likely elicit as many different answers as there are
professional Egyptologists. From this perspective, it is interesting to note Schneider’s choices, as we
compare his answers with our own.
The volume’s weaknesses can be categorized according to structure, content, and presentation.
Structurally, the chief flaw is the lack of a useful introductory note or a progression of information that
would guide the non-specialist reader. Although the preface suggests that the content is aimed at an
introductory level, the questions do not progress in a sequence that would serve to introduce a reader to
ancient Egypt. Question 1, a natural starting point, does not stand out as one of the more approachable
essays. Aside from the somewhat technical discussion of calculating solar calendars, this first essay
uses phrases and terminology that would not necessarily be accessible to a general reader with little
background in ancient Egypt. Names and phrases such as Naqada II culture, Ptolemy III, and Canopus
Decree are used without any explanation other than a corresponding date, which is insufficient contextualization
for a casual reader.
This is compounded by the fact that the entire
first section of the

book,
“Ancient
Egypt
and
the
Modern
World”
(pp.
3–27),
lacks
an
overall
organizational
structure
that

would
facilitate
a
reader’s
engagement.
Topics
range
from
the
aforementioned
solar
calendar
to
Afrocentrism,
the
Romantic
poets
Byron
and
Shelley,
and
twentieth-century
Egyptian
nationalism.
Though

potentially
interesting
in their own right, collectively
they do not succeed in introducing
fundamental

concepts
that
might
give
the
general
reader
the
tools
to
engage
with
the
full
range
of
101
questions.
In some cases, the answers are unsatisfying; questions 48 and 100 are examples of those that fall
short of their potential. “Why did the Egyptians mummify their dead” (question 48) is followed by
an explanation of mummification techniques and their change over time, and aside from a passing
reference to funerary religion and nourishment, there is no direct answer to the why of mummification.
Given the acknowledgement that mummification looms large in the public consciousness (p. 141),
this would have been an opportunity to balance Hollywood’s portrayal of the grotesque, zombie-like
mummy with the Egyptian belief in the continued existence of the soul and the Egyptians’ positive
associations of the mummified body as an image of the deceased, rather than a corpse.
In answer to question 100, “Who is the most famous Egyptologist,” Schneider provides a summary
of fictional Egyptologists—from the lead character in Stargate to recent pieces of historical fiction—
rather than noting the most significant individuals in Egyptology’s actual development over the past
two centuries. Elsewhere Schneider provides useful reviews of aspects of Egyptology as a discipline,
including a concise summary of the academic literature on Egyptian religion (question 38). Question
100 is a missed opportunity to summarize the fascinating and real cast of characters that have contributed
to
Egyptology’s
history.
With regard to presentation, the volume lacks both an index and a list of questions. Without these 
two features, and given the first section’s minimal usefulness as an introduction to ancient Egypt, general
readers
cannot
easily
decide
where
best
to
begin
their
engagement
with
the
content.

for sites and geographic features are tiny and pixelated to the point of illegibility, rendering them of
little use to anyone who is not already familiar with their names.
In conclusion, the wide-ranging assortment of topics and the question-and-answer format will likely
appeal to the casual reader who does not look for structure or background information on ancient
Egypt. It may also be useful to a specialist who wishes to gather fresh ideas for teaching material; it
provides a window into the types of questions that occur to students but are perhaps forgotten by those
who have spent years in specialized study. Certain topics are indeed intriguing, and for those who
find themselves teaching, lecturing, or writing for the general public, it is worth perusing Schneider’s
answers to some of the fundamental questions of Egyptology.

Alexander the Great and Egypt: History, Art, Tradition. Edited by vOLker GrIeB; krzyszTOf
 N
aWOTka; and aGNIeszka WOJcIechOWska. Philippika, vol. 74. Wiesbaden: harrassOWITz
v
erLaG, 2014. Pp. 458, illus. €83.
The present volume, product of a conference held in November 2011 at the University of Wrocław,
in cooperation with Helmut-Schmidt University (Hamburg), is an interdisciplinary foray into Alexander’s
short
stay
in
Egypt
and
his
legacy
in
Egyptian
culture.
Consisting
of
twenty-two
contributions

(excluding
the
introduction),
the
aim
of
the
volume,
according
to
the
editors,
is
“to
look
at
the
Macedonian
king through
the Egyptian
eye,”
using
Egyptian
and
other
non-classical evidence
as a way to

“assess
the
depth
(or
shallowness)
of
the
Greek
veneer
in
Egypt
in
the
age
of
the
Argead
rulers”
(p.
8).

Though
contributions
are
mainly
in
English,
German
and
French
are
also
represented.
Naturally,
there

are
hazards
in
compiling
a
volume
with
such
international
character;
both
the
quality
of
the
editing
and

the
argumentation
of
each
chapter
are
of
inconsistent
nature,
though
that
is
not
to
diminish
the
importance
of
several
scholarly
contributions
throughout
the
work.
Though the volume is organized in a roughly chronological way (beginning with Argead strategic
interest in Egypt and ending with several contributions on the Medieval Alexander Romance), the editors
have
missed
an
opportunity
for
what
could
have
been
a
more
meaningful
thematic
approach.
For

instance,
multiple
authors
address
the
question
of
chronology,
Alexander’s
legitimation
as
pharaoh

(with
heavy focus on the oracle at Siwa),
the foundation of Alexandria and other important building
projects
throughout
Egypt,
his death and burial, the behavior of the Diadochoi, and Alexander’s

reception/legacy.
One
of
the
most
important
threads
throughout
the
volume
is
the
almost
uniform

insistence
on
the
continuity
of
Egyptian
(especially
dynastic)
custom
as
a
major
element
in
Alexander’s

campaign.
Due
to
constrictions
of
space,
I
will
not
focus
on
all
of
the
contributions
in
the
volume,
but

highlight
a
few
outstanding
or
controversial
pieces.
As previously mentioned, as a fascinating piece of reception literature, The Alexander Romance
naturally plays a great role in several studies in this book. Wojciechowska and Nawotka (“Alexander in
Egypt: Chronology”) take this work (which, they argue, uniquely preserves a local tradition that does
not follow the conventional line of Alexander historians) into account, in order to establish a chronology
for
Alexander’s
Egyptian
campaign.
They
settle
on
a
coronation
date
that preceded the
foundation

of
Alexandria in spring of 331
B.c.
In another contribution, “Alexander
the Great
kosmokrator,”
the

same
authors argue that the appellation of Alexander as kosmokrator,
also evident
in The
Romance,

originates
from
an Egyptian
notion of “ruler of the world.”
Their argument is buttressed
by the fact

that this epithet is attested only in Egyptian contexts or sources originating in Egypt (e.g., Manetho). 
The transmission of the idea, the authors suggest, would have occurred in the milieu of Hellenized
Egyptians in the Ptolemaic period. Aleksandra Szalc studies a visit to a Nubian queen’s castle in The
Romance to develop her argument for a literary conflation of Indian and African elements in its description.
This, she argues, is part of a topos
meant
to underline the totality of Alexander’s world
domination

(much
as
can
also
be
found
in
Achaemenid
inscriptions,
most
famously
at
Bisitun).
