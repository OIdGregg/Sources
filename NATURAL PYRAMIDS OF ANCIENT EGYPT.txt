NATURAL PYRAMIDS OF ANCIENT EGYPT: FROM EMULATIONS 
OF MONARCHS TO ROYAL BURIALS 
Wojciech Ejsmond

Abstract: Scholars observed that pyramid shape
hills or rocks (so called ‘natural pyramids’) in
some cases are related to tombs, and some attention

was paid to this phenomenon in the past, but
focusing only on individual cases. So far, the subject
was
never
studied
in a broader
context.
The

aim
of
this
paper
is
to
explore
and
examine
such

landmarks

in ancient Egypt in order to understand,

how this idea developed, and how such
structures were interpreted and utilised. Several
archaeological sites where such structures are
attested were visited and analysed in the context of
funerary landscapes (the research included spatial,

chronological and textual researches). As a 
result, it is clear that such mountains and rocks 
were conceptualised as pyramids. Some of them
were seen as structures meaning ful on their own,
i.e. they were not substitutes for man-made pyramids.

These form an previously overlooked aspect
of Egyptian funerary landscapes showing how
ancient Egyptians projected their beliefs on the
landscape and how they used the landscape to
evoke status and religious symbols. 
Key words: Religion, Funerary landscape, Pyramids,
Tombs.
Elements of a landscape can create associations in
the human mind with objects from different
spheres of experience, e.
 g. certain natural features
of landscape can evoke forms known from architecture
or
religion.
Undoubtedly,
ancient
Egyptians
were
sometimes
conceptualising
elements
of

landscapes
based
on
their
resemblance

In different cultures the relation between buri-
als, landscape and funerary activity can be
observed.
 This phenomenon is poorly explored in
the context of ancient Egypt. Mountains resembling
pyramids
which
are
located
along
the
Nile

form
an
important
subject
of
study.

4
The term “natural pyramid” is applied to natural
formations
which
resemble
man-made
pyramids.
5
 The so-called “natural pyramid” can be 
defined as a natural formation, which takes on a 
pyramidal shape from at least one perspective and
was related with burial practices or funerary
beliefs. Despite the vast interest in the subject of
pyramids in general, this aspect of the topic is
under-researched.
 Recognition by ancient Egyptians
of
some
features
of
a landscape
as
natural

pyramids
is controversial
speculation,

he

question,

was the el-Qurn mountain in Thebes
conceptualised by ancient Egyptians as a pyramid?
7
6
 Because nobody before has researched this
subject
 in general and evaluated the significance
of such conceptualisations, it is a very problematic
issue which requires further studies to better
understand burial customs in ancient Egypt. 
8
In ancient Egypt, man-made pyramids played a
crucial role in the royal funerary complexes and
were strictly associated with kings and mothers of
monarchs until the 18

His paper is the closest to the topic of the natural pyramids
but does not deal with the subject of using such structures
by ancient Egyptians as burial places. Although, according
to its author, the shape of pyramids was inspired by the
enduring nature of the natural features. I do not agree with
Farouk el-Baz. There is no reason for such an assumption. 
 See discussion in ĆWiek in press. 
 With the exception of research on separate rock formations
resembling pyramids (see

Natural pyramids have been mentioned in pub-
lications in the central part of Upper Egypt 
(Fig.
 1)
. The analysis of such structures presented
here demonstrates their important role in the conceptualisations
of
landscapes
in
ancient
Egypt
and

sheds
a
light
on
an
overlooked
aspect
of
the
burial

practices
along
the
Nile.
 Studies on the possible
meanings of such formations and how they were
seen by the ancient Egyptians are difficult since
they were not mentioned in preserved texts (with
one exception (see below)) and their significance
could have been different in various periods.

Five natural pyramids already recognised by
different scholars will be presented below (in geographical
order
from
south
to
north)
and
analysed

in
context
of
the
landscape

as

at
the
natural
pyramid
at
Abydos
from
the
perspective
of
Senwosret
III’s
temple.

In other cases, the main observation points 
11
were in front of the tombs related with the natural
pyramids, and it was noticed that the pyramidal
shape was most clear from such a perspective.
However, in the case of el-Qurn, there are many

offers
glimpses
into

the
potential
symbolic
meaning
of
these
natural

features.
A landscape
can
be
subjected
to
interpretation
by
its
ancient
dwellers
and
modern
researchers.
 This may be a subject of phenomenological
studies, i.e. descriptions and understanding how
past societies were experiencing a landscape in
which they were placed.
12
 Cemeteries in ancient
Egypt were places of social display among different
classes
of
the
society,
13
 thus the landscape
could have become the medium for the manifestation
15
14
 of the social order and beliefs.
A landscape can be structured by monuments 
which directs attention to the focal point(s) and
helps to interpret them.
 The spatial arrangement
of the man-made structures in relation to natural
features include examples from the Moalla,
Gebelein, and Abydos necropoleis where they draw
the viewer’s attention to the natural pyramids. 
16
The approach towards funerary landscapes pre-
 is very useful and
helps to understand this phenomenon. As he
wrote, “The funerary landscape is the reconstruction
in
motion
of
how
it
could
have
been
from
a
single
vantage
point
that
focuses
on
the
phenomenological
relation
between
death,
disposal
of
the

body
in
the
environment
and
the
social
memory
of

the
group
participating
in
the
remembrance
of
the

burial.

[…] The goal of such a funerary landscape
[analysis] is to attempt to represent the most likely
ways in which humans might have experienced the
funerary aspect of their space.”

 Thus, certain
feelings or impressions were evoked by elements

of
natural
pyramids
in
ancient
Egypt,
in
particular:
how
this
idea
developed,

how
such

structures
were
interpreted

large part of southern Egypt, in effect becoming a
sovereign ruler in all but name. As an overseer of
the third Upper Egyptian nome, he conquered the
second nome with his private army, extended his
power to the first district and was trying to expand
to the north as well. His ambitions to appear as an
independent ruler of southern Egypt are clear. As
he stated in his self-presentation: Horus brought
me to the nome of Edfu for life, prosperit y, health,
to re-establish it and I did (it) … I am the vanguard
of
men
and
the
rearguard
of
men.…
A
leader

of the land though the active conduct … I am a
champion without peer.
 Undoubtedly, he also
wanted to express this in the form of his burial. 
24
The tomb of Ankhtifi was cut into the slope of a
rocky hill that is separated from surrounding cliffs.
Most probably, it was chosen due to its pyramidal
shape (despite the bad quality of the rock),
 giving
the nomarch a royal-like status in the landscape and
a preeminent place in the necropolis.

mission
at
Moalla
directed
by
Mark
Collier

has
discovered
previously
unknown
elements
of

26
this burial complex. The original façade of the 
tomb had been carved out of the rock. In front of
the tomb, plastered mud-brick obelisks were constructed.
 The whole complex once included a
courtyard, a causeway and what seems to be the
remnants of a valley temple,
27
 thus emulating Old
Kingdom royal pyramid complexes. Also, other
dignitaries used this natural pyramid as their final
resting place, but their burial complexes are modest

them is needed) do not structure the landscape feature

did.

elite.

There is a necropolis located on the south-east-
ern foothill and slopes of the western hill of
Gebelein.
 The focal point of that cemetery are
two natural spurs (Fig. 3) which were recognised
as natural pyramids by Giovani Bergamini.
34

When one looks at them from the eastern and
north-eastern sides, their pyramidal shape is clear. 
At the foot of the southern spur two safftombs
 have been discovered. Pottery found in the
northern (partly excavated) tomb is dated to the
11
th
36
–12
th
 Dynasty. The burial chamber of the 
northern saff-tomb was hewn into the natural pyr-
 and the crypt of the southern one is
unknown. The northern structure lies on the axis
of the eastern face of the spur. The plans of both
tombs have been determined thanks to a compilation
of
excavation
and
geophysical
prospection

results.

 Both structures are very similar in shape
and are surrounded by burials of rather simple
form. Several niches were cut into the southern
side of the southern natural pyramid. No traces of
such activities were found on its northern face.
This might be due to the inclination of the terrain,
which does not provide an opportunity to cut into
the rock of the northern side compared to the
southern side.

another smaller natural pyramid is located. The

 Only kings and usually mothers of kings were buried in
pyramids, see

Natural pyramids of Ancient Egypt: from emulations of monarchs to royal burials 173
structures that might have been located east of it
were destroyed by an expansion of the agricultural
field. Two shafts are still visible on the lower part
of its eastern face and they are similar to those cut
into the southern natural pyramid. It is possible
that one or two saff-tombs had been located at the
eastern foot of this spur. 
An examination of the archival images of the
area made in the 1920s and 1930s that are kept in
the City’s Archive in Turin, shows that the spurs
did not change their shapes since then. Prehistoric
petroglyphs that are located south of the southern
natural pyramid
 indicates that the rock formation
in the area is solid, thus it seems that the shape of
the rocks did not change much since the First
Intermediate Period. 
39
An interpretation of the natural pyramids at
Gebelein is very difficult due to the lack of sufficient
publications
from
most
of
the
previous
explorations
of
the
cemetery,
and
since
a large
part
of

the
necropolis
has
already
been
destroyed.
 Furthermore,

less than a quarter of one saff-tomb has
been excavated.
 Moreover, there are no inscriptions
which
might
inform
us
about
the
owners
of

the sepulchres. The dating of the pottery found in
the partly excavated tomb is very general (11

Dynast y),
 and it is possible that the burial might
be slightly older than the pottery, because the artefacts
may
be
related
with
the
mortuary
cult
and

therefore

reflect human activities after the initial
burial. Therefore, this construction should be
interpreted in the context of the First Intermediate
Period and early Middle Kingdom. Two interpretations
of
its
meaning
can
be
proposed,
depending

on
whether
the
construction
was
made
after
the

took
control

ciation with the natural pyramid could have
been underlining the very high social status
(possibly comparable to that of a nomarch) of
the deceased, maybe even a connection to the
royal family existed. 
2)
 If the tombs were constructed before the rulers
of the 11
 Dynasty gained control over
Gebelein, the use of the spurs as a pyramid
should be interpreted as an expression of the
kingly ambitions of their owners, who may
have been important dignitaries in the region,
like Ankhtifi. 
th
Pyramid of Thebes
Thebes was one of the most significant places in 
ancient Egypt and the amount of data concerning
this area is plentiful. Layers of meanings accumulated
on
the
local
landscape,
of
which
only
a fraction
can
be
detected
today.
A cultural
landscape

a sense
that
it
is constantly

encultured,
interpreted
and
re-interpreted.
focal point of the local landscape are the Theban 
cliffs (Fig.
 4)
. El-Qurn is the highest peak of that
formation and is surrounded by places of great significance:
most
noticeably
the
mortuary
temples
at

Deir
el-Bahari,
and
the
Valley
of
the
Kings.
 Its
form probably did not change much during the last
few thousand years
 and no traces of manipulation
of
its
shape
were
found.

48
As Christopher Tilley wrote, “Without a name
culturally significant places would not exist, but
only as a raw void, a natural environment.”

Another, magnifying significance of a place addition
would
be
relating
a place
with
a divinity
or

making
it
personified
by
a
god.

Ancient Egyptians
referred to el-Qurn as ta dhnt – “The Peak”.
 It
was associated with Hathor as the goddess of the
Theban necropolis, who was personified as Meretseger
(“She
Who
Loves
Silence”),
since
at
least

the
Middle
Kingdom
period.
 Egyptologists have
debated over its symbolic value.

 The mountain
was referred to as “a natural pyramid” and it was
thought that the recognition of this phenomenon

 The 
47
50
49
by the ancient Egyptians was one of the reasons
why the New Kingdom royal burials were located
in the Valley of the Kings from which the peak’s
pyramidal shape is the most clearly recognisable.

The religious significance of the hills of the 
Theban necropolis could have started in the Middle
Kingdom,
with
the
relation
of
el-Qurn
with

Meretseger.
 It should be noted that Mentuhotep II
already had his tomb complex partly hewn into the
Theban cliffs. This complex can be regarded as a
transition between the Old Kingdom pyramid temple
and

 According to Daniel Polz, they
were making ideological connections between 
56
themselves and previous rulers buried at Thebes 
by choosing such locations (between the earlier
royal necropoleis of et-Tarif and Deir el-Bahari)
and the construction of a pyramid above a royal
interment (previous kings buried at Deir el-Bahari
and et-Tarif were probably constructing pyramids
on top of their sepulchres).
57
 The 18
 Dynasty
abandoned the construction of royal pyramids as
part of a royal burial complex. Since the reign of
Thutmose I or Hatshepsut, royal interments were
located in the Valley of the Kings,

It might be thought that for some reason the rul-

ers lost their interest in constructing pyramids.
When one analyses their tombs and mortuary temples
in
the
context
of
the
local
landscape,
it
is more

likely
that
they
ascribed
the
meaning
of
a pyramid

to
the
natural
formation.

The
shape
of
a pyramid
is thought
to
represent
the
primordial
mound
from
which
the
world

was
created.
 Therefore, the primordial mound
could have been symbolised by a pyramid as well
as a mountain or rock. Man-made pyramids and
natural features resembling them can function as
symbolic representations of the primordial mound
and this leads to the thought that certain mountains
could evoke the primordial mound but not necessarily
a pyramid.
Nevertheless,
the
interment
of
a

king’s

mummy in such a symbolic primordial
mound was making it formally a pyramid. 
60
According to Andrzej Ćwiek, the resemblance
of el-Qurn to man-made pyramids was so convincing
for
the
ancient
Egyptians
that
they
recognised
this
natural
feature
as
a
pyramid
in
its
own

right.
 The evidence is in a partly preserved text
in Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahari, which
contains a word (wdrt) which may be translated as
a “cliff” or “slope”.
61
 An important feature of its
orthography is a five-stepped pyramid sign as a
classifier –
. According to A. Ćwiek, “it
seems that it may directly refer to the idea of the
western mountain as a pyramid”.

with Ćwiek’s inter pretation. 
Therefore, mortuary temples became separated
from tombs and were located on the eastern side of
the Theban cliffs, starting with Amenhotep I and
continued by Hatshepsut’s constr uctions at Deir
el-Bahari.
 According to Andrzej Ćwiek, the
mountains surrounding the peak, down to the bottom

of valleys, were identified by the ancient
Egyptians as a pyramid and el-Qurn was recognised
as
its
pyramidion.
As
he
writes,
“The
tombs

were

therefore hewn in and under the ‘pyramid’”,
in which case New Kingdom mortuary temples
could have been understood as the equivalent of
the mortuary temples of the earlier periods,
64
 thus
rendering the man-made pyramid unnecessary. 
Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahari is a part
of a larger mortuary complex which was intended
to emulate Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom
patterns.
 It includes the tomb itself in the Valley
of the Kings which can be interpreted as located
within the pyramidal structure, i.e. el-Qurn. Hatshepsut’s

complex at Deir el-Bahari was the mortuary
temple
with
the
causeway
at
its
front
and
a
valley
temple.

constructions are: 1) the Middle Kingdom mortu-

Senwosret’s Hidden Tomb
The tomb of Senwosret III at Abydos is located 
south of the Pre- and Early Dynastic royal burials
and New Kingdom mortuary temples. It is situated
at a location dominated by a pronounced natural
peak in the cliffs. When observed from the eastern
direction, it creates the visual impression of a
symmetrical pyramidal-like hill.

Josef Wegner, who discovered this phenome-
73
non, describes its appearance as follows:

As one approaches this corner-point of the
cliffs the physical situation is such that the cliffline
extending
away
in
both
directions
is
hidden
to

view
behind

the mass of the prominence. Near the
base of the gebel in this location there is no visual
contact with the adjacent lines of cliffs. The only
perceptible element becomes the symmetrical bulk
formed by this distinct prominence in the cliffs.
The overwhelming visual impression created is
that of a free-standing, symmetrical natural pyramid.
 (Fig. 5).
The complex incorporates a structure interpret-
74
ed as the valley temple near the cultivation, but the
causeway is missing. Nevertheless, the track leading
from
the
valley
temple
to
the
funerary
enclosure
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
has
been
located.

The hidden entrance to the tomb is placed in the
funerary enclosure (near the base of the cliff) and
leads directly beneath the hill in such a way that
the impression of the natural pyramidal peak has
the highest visual impact by the entrance to the
tomb.
76
 The enclosure had been used for ritual 
activities during the final construction stage of 
Senwosret’s tomb. It was intentionally dismantled
later, thus returning the area to the sandy, lowdesert
landscape
which
had
existed
prior
to
the

inception
of
the
tomb
construction.
 It is likely
that Senwosret’s tomb not only was never planned
to have the permanent built superstructure, but
more so, its builders constructed it to be a completely
concealed
tomb
starting
at
the
base
of
the

cliff
of
southern
Abydos.
78
77

It should be observed that this may have been a 
continuation of the idea visible in the funerary
complex of Mentuhotep II at Deir el-Bahari, where
the entrance to the underground part is also hidden
on the right-hand side of the courtyard. There
might also be a different interpretation (or interpretations)
of
the
shape
of
this
mound.
It
might

have
been
evoking
the
mythical
tomb
of
Osiris
at

Abydos
which
had
its
superstructure
in
the
form

of
a
mound

2008, 134–135) or/and primordial mound (see
leh-
ner 1997, 35). 
Ahmose – Emulation of the Middle Kingdom Idea
Ahmose’s mortuary complex is located 1
 km south 
of Senwosret III’s ensemble. It consists of a temple
and a mud brick pyramid, all located at the edge of
the cultivation. At the foot of the hills, a terrace
temple
 was placed. The axial lines of Ahmose’s
and Senwosret’s constructions are identical. One
can observe that other elements from Senwosret’s
structure have been more or less reproduced by
Ahmose. The main difference is that the complex
of Ahmose does not go below the cliff.
80

One can suspect that Ahmose knew about Sen-
81
wosret’s recognition of the hill as a pyramid. The
fact is that he did not take advantage of the natural
pyramid. Maybe because it was regarded as already
“occupied” by Senwosret? Nevertheless, he constructed
his
true
pyramid
at
the
edge
of
the
cultivation.
Therefore,
one
can
observe
the
Theban
Second
Intermediate
Period
tradition
of
constructing

small
pyramids
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
implemented

at Abydos where it met with Senwosret’s
Middle Kingdom idea of the royal tomb with hidden
entrance
and
without
the
man-made
pyramid.

Evolution of the Idea
The Egyptian landscape is full of rock formations 
of different shapes and it is sometimes a matter of 
80

imagination to identify them as natural pyramids.
Therefore, tracing natural pyramids is a difficult
task because one cannot be certain how such natural
features
were
interpreted
in
ancient
times.
Fur-
thermore, there is no indication that the here pre-
sented natural pyramids were subject of changing
or improving their shapes, to make them look
more like a pyramid. If one can see that they were
a focal point of cemeteries or tombs, the situation
is clearer because architecture tends to structure
our perceptions. 
The central part of Upper Egypt, where natural
pyramids are attested, does not offer a conveniently
located,
elevated
plateau
like
Giza,
where
monumental
structures
could
have
been
constructed.

Furthermore,
the
hills
of
the
Theban
region
would

dwarf
any
pyramid
constructed
nearby.
Instead,

natural
features
in
the
region
were
already
available
and
could
have
been
conceptualised
as
pyramids.

The gathered evidence suggests that natural
features started to be used as pyramids during the
First Intermediate Period. The oldest examples are
the burial complexes of Ankhtifi and other tombs
in its vicinity at Moalla as well as the sepulchres at
Gebelein Central Necropolis. The use of a natural
pyramid by non-royals as a burial place could be
interpreted as an attempt to adopt royal conventions
by
ambitious
dignitaries
to
show
their
prestige.
At
this
stage,
the
natural
pyramids
should
be

regarded
as
substitutes
of
the
man-made
structure.

However,
this
usurpation
of
royal
privileges
did

not survive the reunification of Egypt and a pyramid

for

but he also used pyramid-shaped features at Abydos
as
his
burial
place
or
cenotaph.
Regardless
of

the
place
of
his
actual
burial,
the
utilisation
of
the

mountain
at
Abydos
shows
that
it
had
a
symbolic

value
in
its
own
right.
Therefore,
since
the
Middle

Kingdom,
the
natural
pyramids
cannot
be
seen
as

substitutes
for
man-made
structures.

Senwosret III built his pyramid at Dahshur,
The decision made by Ahmose to create a very
similar complex, mirroring Senwosret’s, can be
explained as a way of emulating Middle Kingdom
burial concepts to link his reign with that
esteemed pharaoh. Furthermore, it demonstrates
that Senwoseret’s complex was known and the
idea behind it, i.e. recognition of the mountain as a
pyramid (or Osiris’ mound/primordial mound) was
known at the end of the Second Intermediate Period
and
the
beginning
of
the
New
Kingdom.
This

concept
of
the
hidden
tomb
was
brought
back
to

Thebes
by
the
rulers
of
the
early
18
th
82
 Dynasty 
where it flourished in the form of the rock-cut 
tombs in the Valley of the Kings. El-Qurn in
Thebes was fully conceptualised as a pyramid,
which is suggested by the use of the pyramidshape
determinative
in
the
word
referring
to
the

peak
of
the
Theban
cliffs.
At
this
stage
of
the

development
of
the
idea,
utilisation
of
this
natural

feature
could
have
had
two
aspects:
the
natural

pyramid
as
playing
the
role
of
the
man-made

structure,
and
the
evocation
of
religious
connotations

with the primordial mound and/or Osiris’
mound as well. 
In conclusion, mountains and rocks which were
conceptualised as pyramids should be viewed as 
82
 Verner 2004, 416–421. 
structures with their own meaning, not as merely
substitutes for man-made pyramids. They form a
genre in the evolution of the burial customs of the
ancient Egyptians which requires further studies.
They reveal the previously overlooked aspect of
the Egyptian funerary landscape that shows how
ancient Egyptians projected their beliefs on the
landscape and how they used the landscape to
evoke status and religious symbols. Natural pyramids
can
also
indicate
how
ancient
Egyptians
may

have
tried
to
construct
the
status
of
the
deceased

by
using
this
special
form
of
landscape
as
a burial

place.

Since this subject has yet to be studied in
depth, it opens up new possibilities for the analysis
of funerary landscapes in Egypt. There might be
more natural pyramids in Egypt but due to a lack
of interest in the subject, such formations could
have previously gone unnoticed.
