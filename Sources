 Monumental
 Mark on
 Ancient
 Egypt
 by BarbaraS. Lesko
 Grand temples and tombs
 and colossal statues bear
 many reminders of Egypt's
 aIlcient queens and fe-
 male pharaohs, but even common
 women left a monumental mark.
 This legacy consists of tomb chapels
 with extensive wall decoration, por-
 trait statues, funerary
 and votive stelae, and _
 offering tables, all _
 bearing the names and
 titles of their owners _==
 or dedicators (even -
 those of their nearest _ g
 relatives). This corpus _b
 iS not well published _a
 and is little studied, _ a
 but has survived in =
 unbelievable quanti- E !
 ties, often because !
 these objects were s
 made of stone. Publi
cation and analysis of
 these monuments has
 unfortunately not
 kept pace with their
 discoveries, so the information gleaned
 from them thus far will be subject to
 correction, or enhancement, as more
 source materials become available.
 Although there is no firm agree-
 ment among Egyptologists on the civil
 rights and economic levels of the dif-
 ferent classes in ancient Egyptian so
ciety-or, indeed, how to distinguish

among them-we know that common

women as well as women in the elite

and royal classes were commemo
rated by physical monuments. I will

concentrate on these monuments,

both artistic and architectural, as a

way of illustrating the independence,
 responsible positions and self-respect
 enjoyed by various classes of women
 in ancient Egyptian society.

 _ I When viewing
 tomb walls, it is easy
 to fall into the trap set by the an-
 cient artistic perspective, where
 figures that are meant to be shown
 seated side by side appear to be sit
ting behind one another. Because

the wife is most often depicted as

the survivor and mourner, she is

often portrayed as supporting or

otherwise clasping her husband. It
 was important for the Egyptian artist
 to present the entire human figure,
 and this necessitated placing the
 wife in such a way that she appears
 to be taking a position behind her
 husband when in fact, she is meant
 to be seen as sitting or standing be
side him, as in sculptured groups

that survive from the three major
 early periods.

 Throughout Egyptian history
 women prominent in tomb scenes are
 most often depicted as companions
 of the men being commemorated.
 Their attainments, such as literacy,
 or their most prestigious public ac
tivities are usually only subtly

hinted at in these portraits (through

the ornaments they hold) and are

mentioned very briefly, if at all, in

the accompanying inscriptions. We

can also wonder why more detailed

descriptions of a man's career,

whether in the military, the civil

service, or the temple hierarchy, are
 not shown, whereas in Old Kingdom
 tombs and some tombs dating to
 later periods the supervising of work
 on estates and workshops is empha
sized. It is likely that religious mo
tivation was behind the choice of

tomb scenes. Perhaps the perpetual

abundance of food and water in the

beyond, even the renewal of the life

cycle, is being assured and not the

continuation of earthly concerns

and identities. Thus tomb scenes are

only of limited value in reconstruct
ing peoples' lives, offering a partial

and biased look at the Egyptian

family and society.
 Nevertheless it is obvious from
 these tomb scenes that ancient
 Egyptian women were respected and
 that they fully mingled in society,
 playing many roles, whether in the
 household, the temple cults, or the
 economic realm. Peasant women are
 depicted as helping with the harvest
 and trapping birds; townswomen are
 shown as professional mourners,
 musicians and dancers, members of
 a temple staff and party guests. Rare,
 though extant, are scenes of a woman
 commanding a boat or buying and
 selling goods in the marketplace
 (Fischer 1989: 21). This gives us a
 strong indication that women wielded
 the family's purchasing power, a
 prestigious and definitely not uni
versal position. Also significant is

evidence that in the earliest histori
cal periods weaving workshops were

filled exclusively by women, whereas

men did not move into this impor
tant industry for several centuries.
 In the Old Kingdom, titles de
noting positions of responsibility

and authority belonged to women of

the elite class, who generally were

closely tied by blood or marriage to

the royal family. Tomb inscriptions

of some women provide startling

evidence of their professional in
volvements. One woman tells of be
ing an overseer of female physicians

(Ghalioungui 1975). Another used

the important titles of judge and

vizier, although they may have been

purely honorific (Fischer 1976: 74
75). There is, however, an abundance

of titles for women in positions of

authority, such as Director of the

Dining Hall, Overseer of Funerary

Priests and Overseer of the Weavers'

House, to name a few (Fischer 1976:

70-71). It would seem that few re
strictions were placed on women of

ability and high social status in the

Old Kingdom. It is interesting to
 note that religious positions were
 not limited to noblewomen, for we
 have found priestesses of major god
desses who bear humble titles such
 as tenant farmer.
 Many administrative, honorific
 and priestly titles for women have
 been recovered from Old Kingdom
 monuments; fewer have been found
 from the Middle Kingdom, which
 followed the First Intermediate
 Period, a time of social and economic

 for women seldom reflect positions
 of authority (Ward 1989: 34-391,
 which suggests political and eco
nomic changes. Instead, they reveal

a range of jobs in the service indus
tries, from scribe to hairdresser,

gardener to miller (Ward 1986: 8-171.
 During the prosperous empire of
 the New Kingdom, the civil service
 and temple hierarchies became even
 more professionalizedt yet there is
 evidence that women again served in
 the cults of major as well as minor
 temples and that they filled some
 administrative positions, such as
 controlling access to temple stores
 (Lesko 1987a: 211. Numerous texts
 have survived from this period, in
cluding court documents and private

letters revealing that women had

their own independent legal identity

on a par with men and that they

could inherit or purchase property

and dispose of it without a male co
signatory or legal guardian. Indeedt

women were heads of households,

testified in court, witnessed docu
ments, acted as executors of their

family estates and assumed the obli
gations of a citizen vis-a-vis the State.
 Numerous records show this was
 true of free women in generalt not
 just those of the gentry (Allam 1985:
 14-221. On a personal levelt it is
 clear that women enjoyed freedom
 of movement and association, that
 they could marry and divorce at will,
 that they engaged in commerce and
 that they were able to exercise
 authority over others in the work-
 place or temple.
 Statuary of women. In addition to
 wall scenes, tombs and temples con-
 tained private statuary of both women
 and men. Private monuments from
 ancient Egypt tend to be diminutivet
 especially if carved out of stone.
 For much of its history, the pair
 statue showing a husband and wife
 (sometimes a son and mother) seated
 side by side was popular. A woman
 was not only portrayed in the com
pany of her husband or son, however,

as individual portraits of women are

found from throughout the centuries.

from Giza discovered earlier this

century by an excavation team from

 As Egypt's empire continued to expand during
 the New Kingdom, a greater cosmopolitan
 sophistication resulted. Typically in this
 more voluptuous age sculptors took great care
 to delineate the curls of women's wigs and
 the texture of their dresses, as exemplified by

 the Eighteenth Dynasty. Photo courtesy of

 than statues, presumably because
 they were easier to produce and cost
 less, are stelae dedicated to preserving
 the memory of individuals. These
 stelae depict the deceased, and
 sometimes family members, seated
 at a table loaded with food and drinl<.
 They are inscribed with the names
 and titles of the owner land usually
 family membersJ together with an
 invocation that was meant either
 magically to perpetuate the offerings
 of "a thousand each of bread, beer,
 usually paired with a male relative,
 there are several statues in which a
 woman is paired with a female rela-
 tive (usually a mother and daughter),
 and there are individual portrait
 sculptures as well. Typically in this
 more voluptuous age the artist took
 great care to delineate the curls
 of the wigs and the texture of the
 dresses. Some of the most enchant
ing individual portraits of women

are done in wood and come from the
 Ramesside age. The lines of their
 slim and always youthful bodies are
 shown through diaphanous linen
 robes with folds and pleats that are
 especially easy to portray in this
 softer medium. Idealistic portrayals
 were very common apparently be
cause the Egyptians believed that

when such depictions were placed in

tombs they would perpetuate them

into eternal life. After all, who would

not lilne to remain young forever?

Private stelae. Even more common
 more lifelike portrayal. Still, one
 wishes for more autobiographical
 information from these monuments.

 Even more common than statues are stelae
 dedicated to preserving the memory of indi
viduals. These stelae depict the deceased,
 and sometimes family members, sitting at a
 table loaded with food and drink. They are
 inscribed with the names and titles of the
 owner together with an invocation designed
 to ensure sustenance to the deceased and
 family. The ma jority of stelae depict husbands
 and wives, but some women had stelae of
 their own or shared them with female rela-
 tives. This painted limestone stela from the
 Middle Kingdom is dedicated to two women,

 other women, presumably of modest means.

 Such monuments tell of
 the roles women played in ancient
 Egyptian society, which, when
 compared with dates of the source
 materials, changed over time. For
 instance, more women held high
ranking priestess positions in the
 Old Kingdom than in the centuries
 immediately following it (Galvin
 1989: 26)
 Up until the Twelfth Dynasty
 (Middle Kingdom), stelae were made
 for funerary purposes only, but
 about half the pieces dating to the
 Middle Kingdom seem to have been
 dedicated during a persoWs life as
 votives for gods. Similarly, small
 stone offering tables bearing the
 names and titles of the dedicators
 were a favorite form of commemora-
 tion as well as an expression of a
 personts piety. A group of 14 offering

 scenes on stelae owned
 by men. Even when the
 father is depicted, he is
 never portrayed as promi
nently as the mother

(Pfluger 1947: 128-29).

The importance of the

mother in the Egyptian

family is reflected in the

literature of all periods
 as well as in the fact that
 Egyptian men, even those
 of the highest social class
 and in highest ranlQs of
 the civil service or the
 military, often placed
 only their mothers'
 names on their monu
ments and other docu
ments. Family groups

predominate on stelae

from all periods. As with

stelae depicting only men,

the number of stelae
 designed exclusively for
 women seems to be small. Scenes on
 funerary stelae usually show a male
 figure, probably a son, performing
 rites before his parents, but occa-
 sionally a female figure officiates.
 Female votive stelae, on which only
 the women dedicator is depicted
 worshiping her favorite deities, have
 been found in numerous town and
 cemetery contexts, such as at Deir
 el-Medineh and Abydos.
 Nineteenth-century archae-
 ologist Auguste Mariette found 23
 Late Period stelae of women bearing
 the religious title chantress together
 in one part of the great national
 shrine and necropolis of Abydos,
 which was sacred to Osiris, a god of
 the dead (Mariette 1880: numbers
 1173-94). Of the 23 stelae, only five
 included a husband's figure and name,
 tables dedicated by women were
 found together at Lisht. They were
 apparently dedicated by women of
 modest means, with titles ranging
 from hall keeper to housemaid and,
 possibly, cleaning lady (Ward 1989:
 33-34).

 The best preserved evidence for the status of
 noble women in the initial stages of pharaonic
 Egypt survives from the Fourth Dynasty

 topped (mastaba) tombs intermixed with
 those of their brothers in the royal Eastern
 Cemetery. Queen MersyanAh III, who died
 before her husband King Khafre and her

 in a large mastaba with above-ground chapels
 inside and outside the superstructure as well
 as an elaborate, beautifully decorated sub
terranean set of rooms hewn in the rock.

 whereas 18 belonged to women alone.
 Most of these were chantresses of
 Osiris, but three served Isis and two
 served Amon. This group of stelae
 suggests that women could exercise
 freedom of choice when it came to
 their funerary monuments; it also
 furthers the possibility that wives
 depicted in limited roles in what
 appears to have been their husbands'
 tomb chapel art may not always have
 been buried with their husbands.
 They could have maintained their
 own religious funerary monuments
 at cemeteries and holy shrines of
 their choosing. Because funerary
 and other religious monuments con
tain little biographical information
 -and do not focus on the concerns of
 everyday life, it is fortunate that
 Egyptian texts in the form of personal
 letters and administrative documents
 abound. From these documents a
 much clearer picture of the lives led
 by ordinary Egyptians can be recon-
 structed (compare James 1962, 1984;
 Cerny 1973; Bierbrier 1982; Romer
 1984; Lesko 1987a, 1987b).
 Monuments of Egyptian Queens
 Tombs belonging exclusively to
 women have survived from the be
ginning of Egyptian history. Some
 queens of the early dynasties were
 commemorated with tombs as large
 as those of kings, testimony to their
 all-important heiress position and to
 their religious significance as daugh
ters and wives of god-kings. However,
 the best preserved evidence for the
 status of noble women in the initial
 stages of pharaonic Egypt survives
 from the Fourth Dynasty (Old King
dom) necropolis at Giza. The wives

and mother of Khufu (Cheops), builder
 of the Great Pyramid, shared with
 him the royal pyramid style tomb,
 its magical qualities and the royal
 funerary religious literature lEdwards
 1986: 189-96, 296-302), a privilege
 not granted even to the male heir
 apparent. Later in the dynasty other
 royal women had their large, flat
topped (mastaba) tombs inter
mingled with those of their brothers

 instance, Queen Mersyankh III, who
 died before her husband King Khafre

 was laid to rest in a large mastaba
 with above-ground chapels inside

 rock (Dunham and Simpson 19741.
 Between the causeways of the
 second and third pyramids at Giza
 lies an impressive tomb built by
 Queen Khentkawes. Living at the

 believed to have been the dynastic
 link to the Fifth Dynasty because
 her most significant title translates
 as Mother of Two Kings of Upper
 and Lower Egypt. One of the sons
 must have been King Neferirkare,
 who built his pyramid tomb at near-
 by Abu Sir; there he provided, on the
 south side, a smaller pyramid tomb
 for Khentkawes, thus restoring to
 her the benefits of such a tomb style.

 have seemed so inferior to the queen

 portrait that recently traveled the
 world as part of the Rarnesses the
 Great exhibition.
 If the wife and family of Rames
ses II are lilliputians next to his four
 colossi at Abu Simbel's greater
 temple, so too is the supreme god
 Re, depicted on his perch above the
 entrance door. The fact that the
 king's family were often depicted at
 the level of the legs of his colossal
 figure should not blind us to the im
portance of the great royal wife in
 Egyptian history. The queen was often
 of purer royal blood than her hus
band, whose claim to the throne she
 legitimized. In religious terms, the
 queen was the embodiment of the
 goddesses Hathor (wife of Re) and
 the Fourth Dynasty, had also elected
 to have this same style of tomb,
 which loolred lilre a giant sarcophagus
 mounted on a high podium. How-
 ever, the practice of providing a pyra
mid tomb for queens continued into

the Sixth Dynasty and the Twelfth
 Dynasty, after which time royal
 pyramids were abandoned in favor of
 more hidden, rock-hewn sepulchres.
 During the Old Kingdom, prin
cesses and wives of powerful men

were often provided with stelae and

statuary for their tombs from the

royal workshops. In time their
 mastaba tomb chapels, like those of
 their husbands, became more and
 more elaborate. Whole suites of
 rooms invaded the mass of the
 mastaba, their walls covered entire-
 ly with depictions of the owners,
 their retinues, and activities on their
 estates. It is unfortunate that the
 publlcation of one of the most sig
nificant tombs of the Sixth Dynasty,

that of Prince Mereruka, neglected the

rooms devoted to his wife, Princess
 Watetkhet-Hor, and concentrated on
 only the husband's part of the tomb
 lDuell 1938). Such were the biases of
 male researchers in the 1930s.
 The monuments of ancient Egyp

to recount here. Many are familiar

to everyone, however, such as the

painted portrait bust of Queen Nefer
titi, wife of the controversial pharaoh

Alrhenaten, or the colossal figure of

Nefertari, wife of Ramesses the Great,

sculpted into the facade of the smaller

temple of Abu Simbel. Larger-than
life statues of queens appeared in the

Old Kingdom and continued into

the Middle Kingdom, but it was dur
ing the Eighteenth and Nineteenth

Dynasties that the most dazzling

array of monuments commemorat
ing great women was produced. The

 Hatshepsut reigned in an age of
 prosperityZ sophistication and rela
tive peaceZ which she claimed to

have kept herself by joining her
 troops across EgyptZs southern boun-
 dary ill displays of military force.
 Hatshepsut was followed on the
 throne by her nephewZ the highly
 capable ruler Thutmose IIII who has
 been called the Napoleon of Egypt
 for his empire building (although he
 was really repeating exploits of
 HatshepsutZs father). Thlltmose III is
 believed to have been responsible for
 the eventual destruction of Hatshep
sutZs monumexlts. If so, we must sus
pect that the memory of this strong
 female pharaoh lingered in the
 minds of her people and was viewed
 as a threat by her male successors.
 Hatshepsut came from a long line
 of dynamic women. Among these
 was Queen Ahmose-Nefertaril wife
 of AhmoseZ founder of the Eighteenth
 Dynasty. Ahmose-Nefextari was
 given considerable authority ixl the
 cult of the King of the Gods whexl
 she was made GodJs Wife of AmonZ
 a position that held a chief role as a
 priestess in the national cult center
 and was provided with goods and
 property legally documexlted and
 published for all to see on a monu-
 mental stela set up in the temple of
 Amon at Karnak (Robins 1983: 70
73). There is no question that

Ahmose-Nefertari functioned active
ly as a priestess in the Amon cult
 and that she wielded considerable
 economic power and controlled build
ing projects at several cult sites
 throughout the country. Even beyond
 thist her royal titles included the ex
ceptional Female Chieftain of Upper

and Lower Egypt, which malnes it
 lilrely that after her husband died
 she ruled as regent for her sont
 Amenhotep I. New Kingdom queens
 generally had to be content with
 having their funerary cult place
 within the mortuary temple of their
 husbandst but Amerlhotep erected a
 mortuary temple for her. Ahmose
Nefertari outlived Amenhotep and

was honored as well by his picked
 Wall paintixlgs in many private
 tombs memorialize the great queen.
 Major monuments of another
 Eighteenth Dynasty queen came un
expectedly to light when a University
 of Toronto excavation team led by
 Donald B. Redford set out to recover
 temples that the heretic king Amen
hotep IV (Akhexlaten) built at Karnak

and dedicated to his new god, the

solar discJ Aten. Such structures

were known to exist because of the

thousands of looseZ small stone

blocks (ta1atat) that had lain un
assembled for many years, like mis
placed pieces of a jigsaw pussleZ in

the shadows of the Karnak temple.

When Canadian and Egyptian archae
ologists began to study the blocks

and uncover moxe from the interior

of the second and tenth pylons (where

the blocks had been reused after

Akhenaten/s temples had been torn

down) the excavators were astonished

to find that the predominant royal

figure in the cult of the god was
 Queen Nefertiti.
 The largest of the two Aten
 temples at Karnak (the Gem Pa Aten)
 had many rows of piexs decorated
 with large scenes of Nefertiti and her
 eldest daughter, MeretatenZ sacrific-
 ing to the sun disk at the high altar.
 Axlother temple, the Maxlsion of the
 Benben Stone (the age-old sacred
 totem of the sun godit was awholly
 given over to the use of the queenZ'
 (Redford 1984: 138). Its pyloned gate
ways also had large scenes showing

the queen and her eldest daughters

as celebrants in the cult. The queen

appears twice as often as her husband

in the talatat scenes and sometimes

in other pharaonic roles, such as in

the guise of a warrior brandishing a

scimitarZ ready to smite a captive

(Redford 1984: 78).
 Egyptologists have yet to resolve
 the question of why Nefertiti is so
 much more prominent than Akhena
ten in scenes at Thebes. Was she as
signed to the sacred city as a repre
sentative of the king ruling from the

old capltal of Memphis in the north?

Such a role later fell to the daughters
 tomb workers of the pharaohs who
 thought of her and her son as their
 special patrons because under them
 the workersZ village in the great
 Theban necropolis was founded.

 name change and even greater politi
cal power for Nefertiti in the guise of

King Smenkhkare (Sampson 1985:

83-99), but recent research on the

royal mummy found in tomb 55 in

the Valley of the Kings (Harris 1989)

seems to confirm that another young

royal man, very likely a brother of

Tutankhamun, preceded Tut on the

throne of the pharaohs. Possibly

Nefertiti had become ill or blind by

middle age-blindness is a distinct

possibility for anyone who stares

directly into the sunfs rays, especially

on numerous occasions-but, in any

case, her days of glory seem to have

been in her youth
 During the last 10 dynasties pri
vate statuary noticeably decreased,

perhaps as a result of economic un
certainties, but numerous monu
ments of various types-statues,

tombs, temple shrines and monu
mental inscriptions-belong to

women of rank in Egypt's postempire
 dynasties, the Third Intermediate
 Period and the Late Period. Pharaohs
 of the Twenty-first to Twenty-third
 Dynasties ruled from the north but
 felt the need to have a family repre
sentative based in the south, a posi
tion which, after the New Kingdom,

became politically independent

under the high priests of Amon.

During this period pharaohs turned

to their daughters and not their sons

to represent their interests in the

south. Thus a royal princess was cus
tomarily married to a Theban high

priest and became a chief concubine

of Amon-Re. The daughter of such a

union would assume the old sacer
dotal title of God's Wife of Amon. As

previously discussed, numerous ben
efices accompanied this title. Decrees

in the name of the R;ing of the Gods

were carved on the walls of Karnak's

seventh and tenth pylons, confirming

the proprietary rights of these royal
 women and extending deification to
 them posthumously. With estates
 and officials to serve them, the God's
 Wives lived like monarchs and car
ried out the official religious func-
 tions hitherto reserved for the king.
 of the monarchs of the Third Inter
mediate Period. Akhenaterl's prede-
 cessor, Amenhotep III, seemsto have
 favored Thebes as his residence, and
 he may have had a closer relation
ship with Nefertiti than is usually
 thought, possibly as the surrogate
 father of her children. If medical
 experts are correct and Akhenaten
 suffered from Froehliclis syndrome
 (a malfunction of the pituitary that
 causes, among other conditions,
 sterilityl, he could not have fathered
 Nefertiti's six daughters (Harris and
 Hussien 1988: 126; Aldred 1988:
 231-321. Her father-in-law, however,
 had already sired several daughters
 and would have been the only rea
sonable answer to the young couple's

desire for heirs. Scenes depicting

Amenhotep III as a corpulent old

man were found at the site of Tell

el-Amarna, where Akhenaten and
 being more obviously physically fit
 than her husband, may simply have
 arrogated to herself political and
 religious power. Once Amenhotep III
 died, however, Nefertiti seems to
 have gradually lost out to her eldest
 daughter, whose presence in inscrip-
 tions began to increase and who
 apparently became her father's new
 favorite (Redford 1984: 187-88).
 Some scholars have argued for a

 of Akhenaterl's reign. It is possible,
 as Cyril Aldred has suggested, that
 these and other scenes indicate

 time (Aldred 1988: 176-821. Thus he

 advantage of his sickly and deformed

 In addition to monumental inscriptions and
 individualportraits, royal women bearing
 the title of God's Wife left funerary monu-
 ments and tombs. Along the southeastern
 corner of the great outer wall of the mortuary
 temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu is a

 Indeed, later pharaohs installed their
 daughters in this important post.
 Impoverishment and insecurity
 marked the postempire period, and
 the Twenty-second Dynasty was
 marked by near civil war between
 Upper and Lower Egypt, leaving the
 door open to invasion from the south.

 pontiff maintained her presence as
 the chief sacerdotal authority in
 Thebes. Indeed, most scholars who
 have written about this phenomenon
 believe that the God's Wife was a
 veritable sovereign of the Theban
 area and areas to the south. Certainly
 the royal women who functioned in
 this office dominated the official art
 of the period.
 Shepenupet I, daughter of the
 last native ruler, was forced to adopt
 Amenirdis I, the daughter of the
 Kushite ruler Kashta, an ardent fol
lower of Amon. Amenirdis I ruled

joirltly with Shepenupet I for at least

13 years. As the God's Wife, Amenir
dis I left many monuments, includ
ing some finely sculptured portraits

of herself. One portrait, now in the

Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Ne
braska, is not the most flattering of

Amenirdis (although it plays down
 her foreign featuresl and harlnens
 back to much older artistic tradi
tions. More innovative and alive is

the faience statuette in Cairo of the

same God's Wife shown in the lap of

the god Amon; they are in a close em
brace, with their arms flung around

each other. No product of Egyptian

artists has ever better displayed such
 passion between lovers.
 In addition to monumental in
scriptions and individual portraits,
 royal women bearing the title of
 God's Wife left funerary monuments
 and tombs. Along the southeastern
 corner of the great outer wall of the
 mortuary temple of Ramesses III at
 Medinet Habu, located on the south
ern end of the west bank at Luxor, is

a series of elegant funeral chapels

(Hoelscher 1954: 17-29). Among the

best preserved is the sandstone chapel

of Amenirdis I with its fine, raised

relief decoration and figures drawn

in "classic proportions and purity of

line" (Aldred 1980: 222). Amenirdis's
 inscriptions, like those of others
 who held the title of God's Wife, de
scribe her as Mistress of Upper and

Lower Egypt, and at death she was
 deified.
 Less than a century after the
 reign of Amenirdis, a northern Egyp
tian leader whose power base was

the city-of Sais in the Nile Delta

came to the fore with Assyrian help
 and founded the Twenty-sixth Dy
nasty. This ruler, Psamtik, had his

young daughter, Nitocris, adopted
 into the College of Divine Adoratrices
 at Thebes, although she had to wait
 her turn during the reigns of Shepe-
 nupet II and her adopted daughter
 (and actual niece) Amenirdis EI. A
 huge granite stela set up at Karnak's
 west end documents Psamtik's formal
 entrance into Thebes and the endow-
 ment to be given to Nitocris after
 the death of those holding the title
 of God's Wife (Caminos 1964: 74 76).
 Nitocris lived for 70 years beyond
 the date of her adoption into the
 priestly hierarchy. She adopted her
 own great niece, Ankhes Neferibres
 Amenirdis I, daughter of the Kushite ruler
 Kashta, ruled jointly with Shepenupet I,
 daughter of the last native ruler, for at least
 13 years during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.
 As the God's Wife, Amenirdis left many
 monuments, including some finely sculp
tured portraits, such as this piece now in the

Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska

(1953. 80). The style of the wig harkens back

to Middle Kingdom and even Old Kingdom

 who became the last God's Wife but
 lost her power in 525 B.C.E. as a result
 of the Persian conquest of Egypt.
 Space does not allow for a review
 of the many monuments dating to
 the Ptolemaic Period and its famous
 queens (most notedly Arsinoe II and
 Cleopatra VII). Suffice it to say that
 although Egypt's last independent
 rulers were foreign born they found
 only at the cost of many lives, and
 this peace was once again broken by
 attacks from the east. Not only did
 mighty Assyria invade Egypt twice,
 but Assyrian troops extended their
 rampage as far up the river as Thebes,
 where they desecrated the great
 temples and stripped them of much
 treasure. Through it all, in unbroken
 succession by adoption, the female

 much to emulate from earlier Egyp
tian culture, the political importance

of the royal women as well as the

grand temples. These rulers also r
spected the age-old legal traditions
 of independence and greater rights
 for women by allowing two law codes
 to coexist so that women-Egyptian
 or Hellene-would not have to suffer
 the constraints of Greek laws but
 would have a choice as to which they
 would use (Pomeroy 1984: 119 20).
 During the classical age, well
read authors were the best publicists

for the independence of the Egyptian

woman, which they found quite shock
ing. The Greek historian Herodotus,

for example, commented:
 As the Egyptians have a climate
 peculiar to themselves . . . so
 have they made all their customs
 and laws of a kind contrary for
 the most part to those of all other
 men. Among them, the women
 buy and sell, the men abide at
 home and weave; and whereas
 in weaving all others push the
 woof upwards, the Egyptians
 push it downwards. Men carry
 burdens on their heads, women
 on their shoulders {Histozy,
 book 2, chapter 35; see Godley
 1966: 315-16).
 Conclusion
 As these monuments show, modern
 archaeology has uncovered concrete
 evidence that ancient Egyptian
 women led full lives. Although
 monuments left by commoners are
 not as large in scale or as fine as
 those of royal woment they are most
 eloquent, for they speak of indepen
dence and self-respect on the part of

many women who lived in Egypt

more than 3,000 years ago.

NATURAL PYRAMIDS OF ANCIENT EGYPT: FROM EMULATIONS 
OF MONARCHS TO ROYAL BURIALS 
Wojciech Ejsmond

Abstract: Scholars observed that pyramid shape
hills or rocks (so called ‘natural pyramids’) in
some cases are related to tombs, and some attention

was paid to this phenomenon in the past, but
focusing only on individual cases. So far, the subject
was
never
studied
in a broader
context.
The

aim
of
this
paper
is
to
explore
and
examine
such

landmarks

in ancient Egypt in order to understand,

how this idea developed, and how such
structures were interpreted and utilised. Several
archaeological sites where such structures are
attested were visited and analysed in the context of
funerary landscapes (the research included spatial,

chronological and textual researches). As a 
result, it is clear that such mountains and rocks 
were conceptualised as pyramids. Some of them
were seen as structures meaning ful on their own,
i.e. they were not substitutes for man-made pyramids.

These form an previously overlooked aspect
of Egyptian funerary landscapes showing how
ancient Egyptians projected their beliefs on the
landscape and how they used the landscape to
evoke status and religious symbols. 
Key words: Religion, Funerary landscape, Pyramids,
Tombs.
Elements of a landscape can create associations in
the human mind with objects from different
spheres of experience, e.
 g. certain natural features
of landscape can evoke forms known from architecture
or
religion.

In different cultures the relation between buri-
als, landscape and funerary activity can be
observed.
 This phenomenon is poorly explored in
the context of ancient Egypt. Mountains resembling
pyramids
which
are
located
along
the
Nile

form
an
important
subject
of
study.

The term “natural pyramid” is applied to natural
formations
which
resemble
man-made
pyramids.
5
 The so-called “natural pyramid” can be 
defined as a natural formation, which takes on a 
pyramidal shape from at least one perspective and
was related with burial practices or funerary
beliefs. Despite the vast interest in the subject of
pyramids in general, this aspect of the topic is
under-researched.
 Recognition by ancient Egyptians
of
some
features
of
a landscape
as
natural

pyramids
is controversial
speculation,
e.

t
he

question,

was the el-Qurn mountain in Thebes
conceptualised by ancient Egyptians as a pyramid?

 Because nobody before has researched this
subject
 in general and evaluated the significance
of such conceptualisations, it is a very problematic
issue which requires further studies to better
understand burial customs in ancient Egypt.

In ancient Egypt, man-made pyramids played a
crucial role in the royal funerary complexes and
were strictly associated with kings and mothers of
monarchs until the 18

His paper is the closest to the topic of the natural pyramids
but does not deal with the subject of using such structures
by ancient Egyptians as burial places. Although, according
to its author, the shape of pyramids was inspired by the
enduring nature of the natural features. I do not agree with
Farouk el-Baz. There is no reason for such an assumption.

meanings of such formations and how they were
seen by the ancient Egyptians are difficult since
they were not mentioned in preserved texts (with
one exception (see below)) and their significance
could have been different in various periods.

into

the
potential
symbolic

of
these

features.
A landscape
can
be
subjected
to
interpretation
by
its
ancient
dwellers
and
modern
researchers.
 This may be a subject of phenomenological
studies, i.e. descriptions and understanding how
past societies were experiencing a landscape in
which they were placed.
12
 Cemeteries in ancient
Egypt were places of social display among different
classes
of
the
society,
13
 thus the landscape
could have become the medium for the manifestation
15
14
 of the social order and beliefs.
A landscape can be structured by monuments 
which directs attention to the focal point(s) and
helps to interpret them.
 The spatial arrangement
of the man-made structures in relation to natural
features include examples from the Moalla,
Gebelein, and Abydos necropoleis where they draw
the viewer’s attention to the natural pyramids. 
16
The approach towards funerary landscapes pre-
 is very useful and
helps to understand this phenomenon. As he
wrote, “The funerary landscape is the reconstruction
in
motion
of
how
it
could
have
been
from
a
single
vantage
point
that
focuses
on
the

and
the

the

participating

of
the

burial.

[…] The goal of such a funerary landscape
[analysis] is to attempt to represent the most likely
ways in which humans might have experienced the
funerary aspect of their space.”

large part of southern Egypt, in effect becoming a
sovereign ruler in all but name. As an overseer of
the third Upper Egyptian nome, he conquered the
second nome with his private army, extended his
power to the first district and was trying to expand
to the north as well. His ambitions to appear as an
independent ruler of southern Egypt are clear. As
he stated in his self-presentation: Horus brought
me to the nome of Edfu for life, prosperit y, health,
to re-establish it and I did (it) … I am the vanguard
of
men
and
the
rearguard
of
men.…
A
leader

of the land though the active conduct … I am a
champion without peer.
 Undoubtedly, he also
wanted to express this in the form of his burial. 
24
The tomb of Ankhtifi was cut into the slope of a
rocky hill that is separated from surrounding cliffs.
Most probably, it was chosen due to its pyramidal
shape (despite the bad quality of the rock),
 giving
the nomarch a royal-like status in the landscape and
a preeminent place in the necropolis.
 The archaeological
mission
at
Moalla
directed
by
Mark
Collier

has
discovered
previously
unknown
elements
of

26
this burial complex. The original façade of the 
tomb had been carved out of the rock. In front of
the tomb, plastered mud-brick obelisks were constructed.
 The whole complex once included a
courtyard, a causeway and what seems to be the
remnants of a valley temple,
27
 thus emulating Old
Kingdom royal pyramid complexes. Also, other
dignitaries used this natural pyramid as their final
resting place, but their burial complexes are modest

Silent Pyramids at Gebelein

place
of
the
provincial
elite.

There is a necropolis located on the south-east-
ern foothill and slopes of the western hill of
Gebelein.
 The focal point of that cemetery are
two natural spurs (Fig. 3) which were recognised
as natural pyramids by Giovani Bergamini.
34

When one looks at them from the eastern and
north-eastern sides, their pyramidal shape is clear. 
At the foot of the southern spur two safftombs
 have been discovered. Pottery found in the
northern (partly excavated) tomb is dated to the
11
th
36
–12
th
 Dynasty. The burial chamber of the 
northern saff-tomb was hewn into the natural pyr-
 and the crypt of the southern one is
unknown. The northern structure lies on the axis
of the eastern face of the spur. The plans of both
tombs have been determined thanks to a compilation
of
excavation
and

results.

37
 Both structures are very similar in shape
and are surrounded by burials of rather simple
form. Several niches were cut into the southern
side of the southern natural pyramid. No traces of
such activities were found on its northern face.
This might be due to the inclination of the terrain,
which does not provide an opportunity to cut into
the rock of the northern side compared to the
southern side.

another smaller natural pyramid is located. The

structures that might have been located east of it
were destroyed by an expansion of the agricultural
field. Two shafts are still visible on the lower part
of its eastern face and they are similar to those cut
into the southern natural pyramid. It is possible
that one or two saff-tombs had been located at the
eastern foot of this spur. 
An examination of the archival images of the
area made in the 1920s and 1930s that are kept in
the City’s Archive in Turin, shows that the spurs
did not change their shapes since then. Prehistoric
petroglyphs that are located south of the southern
natural pyramid
 indicates that the rock formation
in the area is solid, thus it seems that the shape of
the rocks did not change much since the First
Intermediate Period. 
39
An interpretation of the natural pyramids at
Gebelein is very difficult due to the lack of sufficient
publications
from
most
of
the

of
the
cemetery,
and
since
a large
part
of

the

has

destroyed.

less than a quarter of one saff-tomb has
been excavated.

the sepulchres. The dating of the pottery found in
the partly excavated tomb is very general (11

Dynast y),
 and it is possible that the burial might
be slightly older than the pottery, because the artefacts
may
be
related
with
the
mortuary
cult
and

therefore

reflect human activities after the initial
burial. Therefore, this construction should be
interpreted in the context of the First Intermediate
Period and early Middle Kingdom. Two interpretations
of
its
meaning
can
be
proposed,
depending

on
whether
the
construction
was
made
after

ciation with the natural pyramid could have
been underlining the very high social status
(possibly comparable to that of a nomarch) of
the deceased, maybe even a connection to the
royal family existed. 
2)
 If the tombs were constructed before the rulers
of the 11
 Dynasty gained control over
Gebelein, the use of the spurs as a pyramid
should be interpreted as an expression of the
kingly ambitions of their owners, who may
have been important dignitaries in the region,
like Ankhtifi.

ancient Egypt and the amount of data concerning
this area is plentiful. Layers of meanings accumulated

As Christopher Tilley wrote, “Without a name

only as a raw void, a natural environment.”

would
be

a place
with

 The

by the ancient Egyptians was one of the reasons
why the New Kingdom royal burials were located
in the Valley of the Kings from which the peak’s
pyramidal shape is the most clearly recognisable.

The religious significance of the hills of the 
Theban necropolis could have started in the Middle
Kingdom,
with
the
relation
of
el-Qurn
with

Meretseger.
 It should be noted that Mentuhotep II
already had his tomb complex partly hewn into the
Theban cliffs. This complex can be regarded as a
transition between the Old Kingdom pyramid temple

These rulers constructed small pyramids at Dra
Abu el-Naga.
During the Second Intermediate Period, the 17
 According to Daniel Polz, they
were making ideological connections between 
56
themselves and previous rulers buried at Thebes 
by choosing such locations (between the earlier
royal necropoleis of et-Tarif and Deir el-Bahari)
and the construction of a pyramid above a royal
interment (previous kings buried at Deir el-Bahari
and et-Tarif were probably constructing pyramids
on top of their sepulchres).
57
 The 18
 Dynasty
abandoned the construction of royal pyramids as
part of a royal burial complex. Since the reign of
Thutmose I or Hatshepsut, royal interments were
located in the Valley of the Kings,

It might be thought that for some reason the rul-

ers lost their interest in constructing pyramids.

it
is more

that
they

transference could occur by means of spatial relations.
2)
The
shape
of
a pyramid
is thought
to
represent
the
primordial
mound
from
which
the
world

was
created.
 Therefore, the primordial mound
could have been symbolised by a pyramid as well
as a mountain or rock. Man-made pyramids and
natural features resembling them can function as
symbolic representations of the primordial mound
and this leads to the thought that certain mountains
could evoke the primordial mound but not necessarily
a pyramid.
Nevertheless,
the
interment
of
a

king’s

mummy in such a symbolic primordial
mound was making it formally a pyramid. 
60
According to Andrzej Ćwiek, the resemblance
of el-Qurn to man-made pyramids was so convincing
for
the
ancient
Egyptians
that
they
recognised
this
natural
feature
as
a
pyramid
in
its
own

right.
 The evidence is in a partly preserved text
in Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahari, which
contains a word (wdrt) which may be translated as
a “cliff” or “slope”.
61
 An important feature of its
orthography is a five-stepped pyramid sign as a
classifier –
. According to A. Ćwiek, “it
seems that it may directly refer to the idea of the
western mountain as a pyramid”.

 ĆWiek in press. Adiranna Madej is currently researching
this inscription as the subject of her Phd and she agrees
with Ćwiek’s inter pretation. 
Therefore, mortuary temples became separated
from tombs and were located on the eastern side of
the Theban cliffs, starting with Amenhotep I and
continued by Hatshepsut’s constr uctions at Deir
el-Bahari.
 According to Andrzej Ćwiek, the
mountains surrounding the peak, down to the bottom

of valleys, were identified by the ancient
Egyptians as a pyramid and el-Qurn was recognised
as
its
pyramidion.
As
he
writes,
“The
tombs

were

therefore hewn in and under the ‘pyramid’”,
in which case New Kingdom mortuary temples
could have been understood as the equivalent of
the mortuary temples of the earlier periods,
64
 thus
rendering the man-made pyramid unnecessary. 
Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahari is a part
of a larger mortuary complex which was intended
to emulate Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom
patterns.
 It includes the tomb itself in the Valley
of the Kings which can be interpreted as located
within the pyramidal structure, i.e. el-Qurn. Hatshepsut’s

complex at Deir el-Bahari was the mortuary
temple
with
the
causeway
at
its
front
and

temple.

pyramid complexes and Hatshepsut’s mortuary
constructions are: 1) the Middle Kingdom mortu-

Senwosret’s Hidden Tomb
The tomb of Senwosret III at Abydos is located 
south of the Pre- and Early Dynastic royal burials
and New Kingdom mortuary temples. It is situated
at a location dominated by a pronounced natural
peak in the cliffs. When observed from the eastern
direction, it creates the visual impression of a
symmetrical pyramidal-like hill.

As one approaches this corner-point of the
cliffs the physical situation is such that the cliffline
extending
away
in
both
directions
is
hidden
to

view
behind

the mass of the prominence. Near the
base of the gebel in this location there is no visual
contact with the adjacent lines of cliffs. The only
perceptible element becomes the symmetrical bulk
formed by this distinct prominence in the cliffs.
The overwhelming visual impression created is
that of a free-standing, symmetrical natural pyramid.
 (Fig. 5).
The complex incorporates a structure interpret-
74
ed as the valley temple near the cultivation, but the
causeway is missing. Nevertheless, the track leading
from
the
valley
temple
to
the
funerary
enclosure
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
has
been
located.

The hidden entrance to the tomb is placed in the
funerary enclosure (near the base of the cliff) and
leads directly beneath the hill in such a way that
the impression of the natural pyramidal peak has
the highest visual impact by the entrance to the
tomb.
76
 The enclosure had been used for ritual 
activities during the final construction stage of 
Senwosret’s tomb. It was intentionally dismantled
later, thus returning the area to the sandy, lowdesert
landscape
which
had
existed
prior
to
the

inception
of
the
tomb
construction.
 It is likely
that Senwosret’s tomb not only was never planned
to have the permanent built superstructure, but
more so, its builders constructed it to be a completely
concealed
tomb
starting
at
the
base
of
the

cliff
of
southern
Abydos.
78
77

It should be observed that this may have been a 
continuation of the idea visible in the funerary
complex of Mentuhotep II at Deir el-Bahari, where
the entrance to the underground part is also hidden
on the right-hand side of the courtyard. There
might also be a different interpretation (or interpretations)
of
the
shape
of
this
mound.
It
might

have
been
evoking
the
mythical
tomb
of
Osiris
at

had

leh-
ner 1997, 35). 
Ahmose – Emulation of the Middle Kingdom Idea
Ahmose’s mortuary complex is located 1
 km south 
of Senwosret III’s ensemble. It consists of a temple
and a mud brick pyramid, all located at the edge of
the cultivation. At the foot of the hills, a terrace
temple
 was placed. The axial lines of Ahmose’s
and Senwosret’s constructions are identical. One
can observe that other elements from Senwosret’s
structure have been more or less reproduced by
Ahmose. The main difference is that the complex
of Ahmose does not go below the cliff.
80

One can suspect that Ahmose knew about Sen-
81
wosret’s recognition of the hill as a pyramid. The
fact is that he did not take advantage of the natural
pyramid. Maybe because it was regarded as already
“occupied” by Senwosret? Nevertheless, he constructed
his
true
pyramid
at
the
edge
of
the
cultivation.
Therefore,
one
can
observe
the

Period
tradition
of
constructing

small
pyramids
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
was
implemented

at Abydos where it met with Senwosret’s
Middle Kingdom idea of the royal tomb with hidden
entrance
and
without
the
man-made
pyramid.

Evolution of the Idea
The Egyptian landscape is full of rock formations 
of different shapes and it is sometimes a matter of

imagination to identify them as natural pyramids.
Therefore, tracing natural pyramids is a difficult
task because one cannot be certain how such natural
features
were
interpreted
in
ancient
times.
Fur-
thermore, there is no indication that the here pre-
sented natural pyramids were subject of changing
or improving their shapes, to make them look
more like a pyramid. If one can see that they were
a focal point of cemeteries or tombs, the situation
is clearer because architecture tends to structure
our perceptions. 
The central part of Upper Egypt, where natural
pyramids are attested, does not offer a conveniently
located,
elevated
plateau
like
Giza,
where
monumental
structures
could
have
been
constructed.

Furthermore,
the
hills
of
the
Theban
region
would

dwarf
any
pyramid
constructed
nearby.
Instead,

natural
features
in
the
region
were
already
available
and
could
have
been
conceptualised
as
pyramids.

The gathered evidence suggests that natural
features started to be used as pyramids during the
First Intermediate Period. The oldest examples are
the burial complexes of Ankhtifi and other tombs
in its vicinity at Moalla as well as the sepulchres at
Gebelein Central Necropolis. The use of a natural
pyramid by non-royals as a burial place could be
interpreted as an attempt to adopt royal conventions
by
ambitious
dignitaries
to
show
their
prestige.
At
this
stage,
the
natural
pyramids
should
be

regarded
as
substitutes
of
the
man-made
structure.

However,
this
usurpation
of
royal
privileges

but he also used pyramid-shaped features at Abydos
as
his
burial
place
or
cenotaph.
Regardless
of

the
place
of
his
actual
burial,
the
utilisation
of
the

mountain
at
Abydos
shows
that
it
had
a
symbolic

value
in
its
own
right.
Therefore,
since
the
Middle

Kingdom,
the
natural
pyramids
cannot
be
seen
as

substitutes
for
man-made
structures.

Senwosret III built his pyramid at Dahshur,
The decision made by Ahmose to create a very
similar complex, mirroring Senwosret’s, can be
explained as a way of emulating Middle Kingdom
burial concepts to link his reign with that
esteemed pharaoh. Furthermore, it demonstrates
that Senwoseret’s complex was known and the
idea behind it, i.e. recognition of the mountain as a
pyramid (or Osiris’ mound/primordial mound) was
known at the end of the Second Intermediate Period
and
the
beginning
of
the
New
Kingdom.
This

concept
of
the
hidden
tomb
was
brought
back
to

Thebes
by
the
rulers
of
the
early
18
th
82
 Dynasty 
where it flourished in the form of the rock-cut 
tombs in the Valley of the Kings. El-Qurn in
Thebes was fully conceptualised as a pyramid,
which is suggested by the use of the pyramidshape
determinative
in
the
word
referring
to
the

peak
of
the
Theban
cliffs.
At
this
stage
of
the

development
of
the
idea,
utilisation
of
this
natural

feature
could
have
had
two
aspects:
the
natural

pyramid
as
playing
the
role
of
the
man-made

structure,
and
the
evocation
of
religious
connotations

with the primordial mound and/or Osiris’
mound as well. 
In conclusion, mountains and rocks which were
conceptualised as pyramids should be viewed as 
82

structures with their own meaning, not as merely
substitutes for man-made pyramids. They form a
genre in the evolution of the burial customs of the
ancient Egyptians which requires further studies.
They reveal the previously overlooked aspect of
the Egyptian funerary landscape that shows how
ancient Egyptians projected their beliefs on the
landscape and how they used the landscape to
evoke status and religious symbols. Natural pyramids
can
also
indicate
how
ancient
Egyptians
may

have
tried
to
construct
the
status
of
the
deceased

by
using
this
special
form
of
landscape
as
a burial

place.

Since this subject has yet to be studied in
depth, it opens up new possibilities for the analysis
of funerary landscapes in Egypt. There might be
more natural pyramids in Egypt but due to a lack
of interest in the subject, such formations could
have previously gone unnoticed.

of February 5, 2006, when our expedition first looked into
the chamber now known as KV63, the first tomb found
in Egypt's Valley of the Kings since that of Tutankhamun
(KV62) in 1922.
Press speculation was rampant over what the tomb might
hold. Would our expedition find the mummies of royal women from the late
18th Dynasty, such as Queen Nefertiti, thought by some to be Tuts mother?
Or the six princesses she bore to the pharaoh Akhenaten, including Tuts queen,
Ankhesenamun? The mummies of these women have either not been found or
identified. Perhaps they were removed from Akhenatens capital at Amarna when
a later king, presumably Tut, returned to the traditional capital of Thebes on the
Nile opposite the Valley of the Kings. Did Tut rebury them in the Valley?
After taking out several stones blocking the doorway from the tomb shaft
into the chamber, we peered through the narrow opening. Inside, we could see
many large ceramic jars and several wooden coffins, some with yellow-painted
faces. The press speculation was incorrect on all counts. We found no mummies
in any of the tombs seven coffins and no inscriptions to tell us for whom these
coffins were initially intended.
Nefertiti's Eyes
Did the queen's distinctive feature
become a symbol of Egyptian royalty?
by Earl L« Ertman
But while studying the coffins, I discovered - in the eyes of faces painted on
three of them - an intriguing link to Nefertiti, the queen whose name means,
simply, "the beautiful one has come." While none of the coffins held Nefertiti's
remains, the eyes may tell us something unexpected about her celebrated beauty.
Was it in part the result of a genetic syndrome?
If small (the not natural gilt a royal coffinette, salt tomb, used two in what large mummification), alabaster was KV63? vessels, Finds and floral many include garlands, ceramics. the seven pillows, It coffins, seems natron to a
small gilt coffinette, two large alabaster vessels, floral garlands, pillows, natron
(the natural salt used in mummification), and many ceramics. It seems to
have been a cache of material used by embalmers, but including coffins, unused
or salvaged from disturbed burials, suitable for upper-class, but not elite or
royal, funerals.
Although KV63 didn't yield the mummies of Nefertiti, Ankhesenamun,
and the rest, the tomb is linked to Tutankhamuns time. Seal impressions found
there match some discovered in Tuts tomb, which is just 50 feet away. KV63s
date should fall within or close to Tuts reign (1343-1333 b.c.), but association
with his burial is uncertain at this point. Perhaps we will gain further evidence
for the date of KV63 from the contents of the remaining 16, of 28 total, storage
jars that we plan to open this season.
Otto Schaden, our expedition director, asked me, as staff art historian and
object analyst, if any information could be gleaned from the coffins to narrow
this date range. I began with the four coffins that had yellow-painted faces. The

This stela from Amarna shows Queen
Nefertiti holding two of her daughters.
It is one of the earliest depictions of her
peculiar eye shape. Her husband, the
pharaoh Akhenaten, appears on the same
relief with normal eyes.
Detail of a relief showing Nefertiti
kissing one of her daughters, perhaps
Meritaten, who is depicted with the
same eye shape as her mother.
KV63 coffins were almost totally destroyed by
termites, but the faces were made separately Faces
on coffins were often covered with thin plaster
or gesso as a base for gilding or painting (as in
the KV63 coffins) ♦ The termites seem to prefer
untreated wood, so while the remainder of the
coffins were mostly consumed, the gessoed and
painted faces survived»
In the art of the ancient Near East, including
Egypt, females were generally depicted with lighter
skin than males» Were the coffins with light yellow
faces made for women? Two such coffins in
museum collections, however, were inscribed for
males» Furthermore, a painting in a tomb in Thebes
shows coffins of Nebamun and Ipuky, sculptors
who worked during the reigns of kings Amen-
hotep III and his son Akhenaten» Each of their
black coffins has a yellow-painted face» So rather
than indicating the coffins were for females, the yellow faces
probably copied those of the very wealthy, who could afford
gold faces on their coffins»
With no inscriptions and the ambiguous nature of the
yellow face color, I began looking at other characteristics
that might prove helpful, such as the shape and details of the
faces» In doing that, the eyes on three of the painted KV63
coffins brought me back to Nefertiti»
Nefertiti is best known from the painted bust of her
found at Amarna and now in Berlin» Her parentage is not
entirely certain, but most Egyptologists believe she was the
daughter of the powerful courtier Ay, who eventually succeeded
Tutankhamun»
The face of one, which we designated coffin A, had eyes
rimmed with blue glass in a traditional shape, unlike the
other three coffins with yellow faces, designated B, F, and
G» What links the eyes of these three coffins, beside the fact
that all are painted, is that the inner canthus - the corner
of the eye near the nose - descends abruptly and abuts the
upper lid, giving them an East Asian appearance» Nefertiti s
famous bust illustrates this eye shape better than words»
Both her proper right eye and the empty socket of the left

of this eye shape?
Art when titi of reigned, Akhenaten the Amarna is noted and period, Nefer- for its
when Akhenaten and Nefertiti
reigned, is noted for its
naturalistic depiction of plants and
animals and, in some cases, candid
scenes of daily life» So one might
suggest that the shape of Nefertiti s
eyes may be an attempt to render her
features as they actually appeared»
One of the earliest appearances of
ARCHAEOLOGY • March/April 2008
A wooden head of Tutankhamun
emerging from a lotus flower,
found in his tomb, shows the
young pharaoh with eyes like
those of Nefertiti, who may have
been his mother.
Coffin F is one of three from KV63, an
embalmer's cache from around the time of
Tutankhamun, that shows faces with eyes
shaped similarly to Nefertiti's.
Nefertiti s unusual eye shape is on a stela showing the royal
family Found at Amarna and now in Berlin, it is dated by an
inscription to before years 8 through 12 of Akhenatens reign,
or around 1350 b.c. On the stela, however, Akhenatens eye
shape is "normal" and resembles those seen on sculptures of
him in Thebes, but Nefertitis is not« So this stela may show
a real, physical condition»
It could be that Nefertiti had an epicanthic fold, a piece
of skin from the upper eyelid covering the inner edge of the
eye. This feature is found not just in people of East Asian
descent, but also in individuals with a number of differ-
ent syndromes - groups of symptoms characteristic of an
abnormality - some of which are genetically based. Some
syndromes are debilitating, others less so, and still others
are passed only from mothers to daughters. We are currendy
investigating the possibility that Nefertitis eyes reflect such
an underlying physical condition, but without her remains
no diagnosis can be made (and the evidence may have been
destroyed or altered during mummification).
If a genetically based physical trait was the basis for this
eye shape, did Nefertiti pass it on to her children and was it
recorded in the appearance of their eyes in artwork? Images
of Nefertiti show the trait more frequendy and markedly
than those of any other individual portrayed at Amarna.
German excavators at Amarna in 1912 found many repre-
sentations of Nefertiti and her daughters in the studio of an
artist named Tuthmosis, including the painted bust of Nefertiti.
Many of these representations are in various stages of
completion,
but their distinctive eyes are easily noticed. This
is
especially clear in a relief, now in the Brooklyn Museum,
that
may show Meritaten, the queens eldest daughter.
It is possible that Nefertiti was Tutankhamuns mother.
If so, it wouldn't be surprising if he were shown with an eye
shape similar to hers. This is the case with some depictions,
such as a wooden head of the young pharaoh that was found
in his tomb. It shows his head, sprouting from a lotus bloom,
with eyes that match those of Nefertiti. Other explanations
for its appearance with Tut include the possibility that
his mother was not Nefertiti but perhaps a woman of the
extended royal family who also carried the trait. And it could
even be that Tut did not have the eye shape himself, if his
mother was a woman other than Nefertiti who did not have

Playing into the Past

Reconsidering the Educational Promise of Public History Exhibits


Brenda Trofanenko




Throughout its history, the public museum has been a powerful educational institution. As one of the most prestigious of public spaces where valued material objects serve as essential forms of evidence of art, culture, history, and science, the public museum mediates the knowledge produced by its exhibitions and displays with the various attending publics, as a means to define, educate, and impress its citizens.1  In public history museums, vari- ous objects, images, and narratives of the past are marshaled in the name of the nation, which collectively contribute directly to the construction and presentation of a specific history.2 Public history museums remain one of the most popular and trustworthy places from which our youth gain an under- standing of the past, and as a result, they hold much influence.3
Recently, public history museums are moving beyond the traditional museum displays to entertain new ways of displaying objects and informa- tion. The advent of digital technologies (notably the world wide web) has prompted public history museums to reexamine their specific knowledge paradigms. The opportunities offered by Google, YouTube, and Flickr, for example, have transformed the collections and information about the col- lections into a more open flow. Visitors may now attend museums that link their collection searches to Google, placing them in a wider flow of intercon- nected cultural, political, economic, and technological ideas and resources. Through these public spaces, visitors are able to garner knowledge within wider cultural and social contexts.
The last several years have witnessed the emergence of an increasingly robust collection of research and scholarship on museums and digital technologies.4

Several issues have emerged. The first, initially raised by Michelle Henning5 is whether history museums (like other disciplinary museums) are placing an increasing emphasis on their experiential and performative aspects in exhi- bitions, resulting in decreasing opportunities for public engagement with historical inquiry through identifying information from the objects, com- paring and corroborating information, and analyzing information in order to understand issues associated with historical events. The second, as noted by Fiona Cameron, addresses the current mandates and authority of many museums, which continue to posit the bricks-and-mortar museum as a privi- leged symbol of the past, of culture, and of national identity, and simplify the information each object provides the public, when various available technol- ogies could contextualize that information and support knowledge creation.6
Museums are presently deciding whether, and to what extent, to adopt web
2.0 platforms and practices. Adoption of these technologies could promote the public’s engagement with museum collections, and support feedback and relationships with those who have attended museums and those who share a common interest. At the same time, adoption of these technologies may mean that the museum no longer controls what knowledge is created, and is instead contributing to a more collaborative production and sharing of knowledge.7
There is a moment when visiting history museums when the full measure of the intersection between the past and the present reveals itself. This rela- tion occurs through displayed objects entwined with narratives that inform the visitor of what has passed. Images, objects, and narratives are selected to authenticate history and to represent interconnected and divergent past events. While this complexity comes across in a simplified and objective manner through which knowledge is to be gained directly from the object, history is considered something “taken in and taken home.”8  This didactic notion ignores the contemporary debates about how knowledge is inter- actively produced, consumed, and distributed in a museum. History muse- ums grapple with contemporary debates about issues, including their public relevance and usefulness and knowledge production.9  The increased utiliza- tion of technologies raises questions for museums about how best to use social media in pedagogically sound ways that support their mandates, per- sonnel expertise, and public expectations.10 It is not enough for museums to focus specifically on the idea of “if we build it they will come” but instead, to consider how to meld their various mandates with the increasingly prolific technologies.
When considering the playful nature of history by way of historical inquiry, as noted in chapters 6 and 7 in this volume by Sean Gouglas and Bethany Nowviskie et al., the digital media and computer technologies that 
Playing into the Past /  259

may support such inquiry are often mismatched. Certainly, the increas- ing commitment by scholars and cultural heritage institutions (including museums, archives, and libraries) to democratizing history by encouraging people to participate in preserving and presenting the past has opened up increasing access to resources. What is often missing, though, is providing opportunities for youth to work with tools in order to gain meaningfully from these resources. I am often at a loss in understanding why displays and exhibitions revert back to a didactic transmission of knowledge even when the institution itself is utilizing various technologies and the youth attending are engaged with these technologies beyond the museum. Why do museums limit the playful engagement in understanding the past when history is a dynamic and playful discipline? There are two reasons. The first is that museums attempt to advance and achieve their broad educational mission with an obvious end goal of presenting factual knowledge about the past. The second answer is related to how history is defined in history muse- ums: the traditional presentation of history in museums relies on objects and text panels. The objects serve as evidence that a past did indeed exist, while the text panels attempt to provide the narrative context of the his- torical event. The history presented in a museum is often one framed as the commodity to be taken from the museum. The knowledge gained from any object is often thought to be singular and truthful instead of multiple and open to interpretation. The public history museum’s role as a communicator of messages and the public as the recipients of those messages depend on the objects as “utterances”—instances of “speech” organized into a “gram- mar” through practices of collection and display.11  This dependence on an object-based epistemology, where “the focus is on what knowledge is gained directly from the object itself,” ignores what information can be attained within and beyond the museum through the utilization of technologies.12
The availability of additional information that contextualizes what is placed on display can extend the knowledge drawn from the exhibition itself. It seems as though the opportunities to engage in playfulness within the museum are limited in exhibits, where the materiality within the museum carries authority as evidence and knowledge. By utilizing various technolo- gies that provide additional text, images, maps, and the like, museums can provide students with increased sources from which to understand what is on display, what relevance it may hold to historical understanding, as well as transforming the museum from an authority to a facilitator.
I have argued elsewhere that youth have the capacity to develop a his- torical consciousness and to question what historical narratives are proffered in public history exhibits and for what purposes.13 I have also argued that museums need to allow for, and invite, opportunities for our youth to critique 
260 /  Pa s T P L ay

the exhibit itself in order to advance the museum’s educational mandate.14
Can the knowledge gained from a history museum go beyond the didactic knowledge deemed essential? Can public history museums move away from being the sole authority of knowledge in order to advance their historical democratic sensibilities? In this chapter, I offer insight on how a group of students engaged the National Museum of American History (NMAH) in Washington, D.C., as they worked to understand the museum as an educa- tional source. This research will serve as a call to educators to reconceptualize the museum as a pedagogical site, to invite our youth to advance their own learning about the past through the interchange between the museum and technology, and to utilize the technologies beyond the museum to return to the playfulness of learning. Here I present a brief explanation of a research project involving students developing a digital mash-up, a media project mixing various texts, graphics, audio, and video, to advance their own his- torical knowledge about war and its role in U.S. identity formation.


Research Context

In the fall of 2005, I began a multiyear research project that involved work- ing with a group of grade 8 students at a charter school in Washington, D.C. The large-scale project focused on how students came to understand identity formation, how identity is defined and by whom, and how indi- vidual and collective identities are advanced through specific public institu- tions (including schools, museums, archives, and memorials) and particular school subjects (including history, literature, and biology). This particular study also provided an opportunity to examine how various technologies were utilized to  aid classroom instruction  and  student  learning, which served to satisfy one of the charter school’s main mandates. A second feature of this study was the weekly off-site activities, also a school mandate, which included (in this case) a regularly scheduled day-long experience in several of the museums within the Smithsonian Institute organization.
During the three months I spent in the classroom, I observed the teacher working with the students to understand the association between history and identity, and the relevance of museums in defining both personal and collective identities through history. Each day I witnessed various teacher and student activities: the teacher providing directed lectures about working with source materials, the students attempting to understand what infor- mation the selected source material provided to their overarching focus, and both the teacher and the students engaging in discussions and debates about who defines what history is, when displayed in the public realm of a 
Playing into the Past /  261

museum. As well, I observed how the students utilized various social media and web-based technologies in their own classroom learning opportunities, and how the teacher explained the ways in which technology served various pedagogical purposes.
The teacher’s own educational background as a historian and as an educa- tor ensured that the students received instruction about history’s disciplinary elements (notably: close reading of the source, textual analysis, identifying corroborative information, and narrative structure and argument). She also provided learning activities she believed were pedagogically sound, which allowed the students to understand the art of history instead of solely learn- ing historical fact (specifically the identification, analysis, and comparison of source materials to formulate an argument). This commitment was evident in various ways: in the classroom activities undertaken prior to the museum visits; the weekly museum visits that extended throughout the school day; and the post-visit classroom activities (which resulted in the production of a five-minute mash-up video that incorporated digital archival documents, music, altered photographs, and exhibition objects that highlighted the stu- dents’ representation of a collective U.S. identity). These mash-ups provided the students with an opportunity to present their own meta-narratives of the museum’s representation of a collective identity vis-à-vis war and military engagement. The students visited the National Museum of American His- tory to understand its role in defining both personal and collective identi- ties, with weekly dedicated time spent in The Price of Freedom: Americans at War exhibit.15
Prior to attending the exhibit, the students debated the relationship between history and identity and the purpose museums serve to both. Sev- eral open and frank discussions about the learning that occurred (or not) within a museum also took place prior to and throughout the unit. The teaching directed the students to examine selected objects and “read” the information easily obtained from the label, consider how this information contributed to the larger exhibition narrative, and argue its broader applica- tion to identity formation. The teacher-student interactions also focused on how the students could use various technologies (Google, YouTube, Flickr, digital collections from the Smithsonian Institute, the Library of Congress, the National Archives and Records, for example) to gain information that would inform their mash-up videos.
Students were evaluated on their understanding of history at several stages during the study, including student engagement with digital technol- ogies (as directed by the school’s charter-mandate), informal conversations between the teacher and students about their works in progress, written justification of selected topic and suitable sources, and the final mash-up. 
262 /  Pa s T P L ay

The students were assessed on basic historic information obtained from the exhibit, how their selected exhibition element (an object, theme, or nar- rative) aligned with their mash-up theme, and the support of their argu- ment of the museum’s role in identity formation. The evaluation included classroom-based examinations and grading of the final project. While the teacher did not assume all students could engage with technologies to an equal skill and complexity level, she knew individual student abilities (and organized the student groups to ensure various abilities).


Research Results

The NMAH, like other museums, is a “guardian of important things,” of objects and material goods displayed in order to advance their educational purpose of providing experiences from which the attending public can learn about the past.16 The objects assume an object-based epistemology; each is readily conceptualized and offers, as Henrietta Riegel noted, “a lesson at a glance, a confirmation of actual life as documented and preserved.”17   The physical objects serve as the evidence on which history depends for verifica- tion, and their presence in the museum provides the authority for museums to tell a their selected story of a past. Andreas Huyssen, for example, argues that “one reason for the new found strength of the museum in the public sphere may have something to do with the fact that it offers the material quality of the object.”18
This point was not lost on the students. When asked about the museum’s educational role, a student named Stuart replied that this exhibit was “more than a collection of guns.” But he quickly followed up by saying that “you can learn more about guns, if you really, really want to.” He listed, and then showed, the various sites where he and his group obtained information and noted the ease of a Google search and the amount of sources from which he may draw. He acknowledged openly the necessity of objects as the basis of learning within the museum, but also noted the limited information pro- vided by each object within the exhibit. His group used guns as a point of reference for their mash-up. He also spoke about how his group, when bringing in computers to the exhibit, would access sites to present immedi- ate additional information, which would then have to be analyzed as to their relevance and dependability.
Stuart and his fellow group members (Lisa, Luci, and Paulo) spoke at length about the limits of the exhibit and the information gained from the objects. Lisa stated that the obvious knowledge gained from the object “depends on the label,” while Paulo noted that  people bring their own 
Playing into the Past /  263

knowledge to the exhibit. The exchange among the group members moved to  how they used various technologies through  their  assignment. They included videos they completed of the exhibit itself, photos of the material objects displayed, pictures of the text panels and tags, and clips from movies that featured guns (specifically war movies and westerns). Their mash-up, which they called How the West Was One, centered on the idea of guns as a metaphor for bringing together and dispersing people.
Perhaps the most cogent point in the student discussions concerned how history is presented in the NMAH  through the displayed objects found within a temporal 3D space organized around a time line. The students col- lectively highlighted how objects considered relevant to an exhibition were arranged near key dates to illustrate the points on the time line and to fit neatly into the chronology of events. Lisa pointedly argued, following Alun Munslow’s claim, that history is “assembled as a string of selected and linked events and recounted in the shape of a narrative.”19 The NMAH  follows Munslow’s claim that the traditional exhibition standard is to “turn the dis- played objects into something else [a narrative]—that which we call his- tory.”20 Lisa echoed this point when she stated how “boring” she found the display of objects. She extended this point by noting how each object forms an “incomplete sentence in a historical narrative” and served to contribute to “an otherwise really, really boring exhibit.”
This expression of boredom about the exhibit is akin to the commonly held belief that history is a subject that is uninviting and dull. When pressed further about this detail, the four students spoke openly about their own knowledge of the playfulness of history, noting specifically how history “can serve as a game where you can learn without thinking that you are learning.” Paulo further explained, when pressed, that the element of play within his- tory is “finding knowledge you never knew, is like going through a maze. . . . You know, when you hit a wall you have to rethink everything. You bring in more information to understand and get past the block . . . and then you have to decide if the knowledge is necessary or useful.” The students collec- tively suggested such playfulness was absent in the exhibit, even in those sec- tions that had a technological base (such as the expansive television monitors featuring broadcasts of the Vietnam War). It was the mash-up assignment that provided the students with the challenge of engaging in the art of his- tory through a commonly utilized media.
While many would consider the student mash-up videos to be a playful example of how students could advance their technological skills, I argue that it allowed the students to rethink how they learn about the past. Their interaction with various technologies worked to  build an expression of their knowledge about the relationship between history and identity. The 
264 /  Pa s T P L ay

mash-up itself, while clearly an activity to engage the students, was effective because much of the content presented works through a combination of knowing something new (in the case of Stuart’s group, how the identity of American men is one of strength and hardiness) with a more interesting way of presenting the information. The mash-up presented a combination of aesthetic appreciation (including a sepia tone along with computer-created graphics of blood) and the cultural memories of the West as a nostalgic time and place. The mash-up included a sound track containing Western background music (from, no less, The Magnificent Seven and How the West Was Won), photographs of the students themselves inserted into the archival documents and exhibit, and the students’ physical presence in the museum exhibit. Accompanying the mash-up were images of guns displayed in the museum, transposed pictures of massive U.S. casualties from the Vietnam War, and a film clip of a confrontation between natives and non-natives. Will these students ever attend another museum and know that they can gain more information about what they see in front of them through the digital realm? I suspect so. And I also suspect that they have some sense that learning the past can be fun, and that museums do have a particular purpose. As one of them stated: “I know they [the museum] has all of these objects. I just don’t know what they want us to learn about the objects.”


Discussion

Commentators have lately expressed concern about the apparent lack of his- torical knowledge held by our youth. In their arguments about the short- comings of public education in the United States, education policy makers frequently use standardized test results (specifically the National Assessment of Educational Progress results) to show the limited knowledge students possess. The response to this lack of knowledge was a movement toward widespread utilization of primary source materials and the dependence on document-based questioning as the basis for history education. By using pri- mary and secondary sources, it continues to be argued, students can develop historical knowledge by engaging in the act of history.21 The focus on the development of content knowledge (the “what” of history) and procedural skills (the “how” of history) can be included in the larger issues of asking why particular representations are presented within the museum. These stu- dents came to understand how knowledge is constructed in the museum, as well as how knowledge can be reconstructed using digital technologies. Their goal was to create a mash-up that included a narrative about history and national identity. They learned many new technological skills. They not 
Playing into the Past /  265

only gained a rudimentary skill set related to the use of iMovie, but they also acquired and presented a mature understanding of where other information may be found. To formulate their arguments about history and museums, they identified and located additional information necessary for their argu- ment. Although some students in this study saw the formation of identity through history in fairly narrow terms—that history itself was a static ele- ment without opportunity to change—most were engaged in a more critical process consistent with the concept of historical consciousness, that is, the ability to understand through critique how a particular historical representa- tion serves specific purposes.
The use of technology within the public history museum appears to aid museums in achieving their educational mandates. Researchers within the museum studies discipline over the last five to six years have investigated how museums are utilizing web 2.0 technologies, including social media such as Twitter and Flickr.22 From the development of digital collections, to accessing information through museum dashboards, through specifically developed smartphone apps (to name only a few), museum personnel are identifying technology that may serve a useful purpose for the museum. But the students whom I studied expressed a critique of the technology used within the exhibit, which we should take as a warning about the educational potential of technology. The students gathered information additional to that presented by the exhibition labels and text panels by producing digital media files creating their own narratives about the exhibit. The additional information gathered allowed for a more open and flexible collection of knowledge specific to the interests of the students. When questioned by the museum personnel about their lack of engagement with the various technol- ogies incorporated into the exhibit itself, the students cogently argued that the digital media within the exhibit reflected the museum’s current techno- logical focus (which assumed such technologies would be a draw for youth to learning from the exhibit). Yet, the students also thought that the technology within the exhibits (limited to looped films and still photographs displayed on walls) did not specifically contribute to furthering their knowledge. The students realized that the History Channel and a local independent media company produced many of the media elements within the museum (indi- viduals within the videos were actors and not “real” Medal of Honor recipi- ents), and they spoke critically about the use of a perceived authentic award to gain an emotional tie to the exhibits’ larger message (of connecting the necessity of conflict to that of freedom). Although the museum did claim to engage with technology primarily in the form of media, such technologies were as didactic and directed as any of the objects, text panels, and labels. The students used other sources available online and drawn from other sites 
266 /  Pa s T P L ay

beyond the museum while wondering about the museum’s parallel online exhibit. The students considered the online exhibit a missed opportunity in accessing additional information about the exhibit, the wars included in the exhibit, and the objects constituting each display. Instead, the students’ awareness of the site was apparent during the research when they discovered it through an online search.


Conclusions

The public history museum continues to grapple with ensuring that  its educational relevance continues as it addresses the challenges of incorporat- ing various technologies into its public mandates. Not only are museums dealing with making information about their objects and exhibits open and accessible, they are also dealing with a public who comes to expect oppor- tunity to find such technologies available within exhibits. This change chal- lenges educators and museums to rethink how historical inquiry in public history museums can be supported through the use of technology. How can museums provide opportunities within their exhibition spaces (and on dedicated websites) to engage in historical inquiry that moves beyond text labels and objects? How can museums come to support exhibits that actively engage students to critique what is presented and develop an understanding about the importance of such a presentation? The challenge facing public history museums is working toward changing their own (and the public’s) conception of the museum as a knowledge authority. Instead, I suggest, there is a need for museums to consider themselves as brokers of knowledge and that such knowledge can come through engagement with technology within and beyond the museum.
Although previous research has demonstrated that our youth may be actively involved in appropriating or resisting particular historical narratives, many of those involved in this study were engaged in a more complex pro- cess. The four students I interviewed and observed clearly pointed out the limitations within the museum that inhibited their understanding about the past. The knowledge they developed in the classroom led them to seek additional information when in the museum, and they struggled to integrate new ideas they encountered in each. Although some of the students simply accepted the history narrative displayed in the museum, most were aware that the objects and the narratives were used for advancing a particular collective identity. By being aware that by utilizing various technologies, they came to appreciate the fact that their own education exposed them to the playfulness technology offered and appreciated the fact that technology could encourage 
Playing into the Past /  267

a more critical historical perspective, particularly by exposing them to source materials beyond the museum. Even as they sought to expand their own historical viewpoints, however, they were willing to acknowledge the limited information presented by the museum. Both the highly contentious nature of historical representations in the United States and the factual empha- sis of the school curriculum may contribute to students simply accepting or rejecting historical narratives based on personal experience, preferences, or prior knowledge. This points, then, to the value of historical study that focuses on students’ utilization of technology to gain experience working with tools (which may well be computer based) in order to enrich their own historical understanding through digital media. I am not suggesting that every student attending a public museum ought to be engaged in a mash-up experience. What I am suggesting is that we need to harness the interest students do hold in history to activities that will fashion a set of skills and knowledge. By asking our youth to be critical of the history presented in public museums is not to ignore the importance each institution holds in providing such information. Can our youth problem solve, communicate, or be creative and innovative by attending a history museum? I cannot say for certain. But I can suggest the need for public history museums to provide opportunities for those youth who are interested in knowing and learning more about the past, something that can easily be done within museums with the open web access many provide their public. Those opportunities can be vehicles for bringing these youth into rich conversations about our past, about museums and education, and about how their skills and knowl- edge are developed outside of the traditional classroom.

 creativity. And with the flow of serotonin and
 other neurotransmitters involved in the brain's
 reward system. Humor enhances happiness.
 Curiosity creates happiness. There is that "set
 point" wherein some folks are born happy and
 some are born with the blues. But set points
 have been questioned, and identical-twin stud-
 ies should in any case be salted with the infor-
 mation that genes are not fixed but affected
 by the environment; identical twins are not
 quite identical.
 So, how do we strive for more happiness?
 One way is to keep our minds open to con-
 trasting ideas and approaches. Avoid "tunnel
 vision," Bok says, "premature closure" that
 insists on this or that single way to happiness,
 with all alternate roads leading to hell.
 Developing a greater capacity to feel grati-
 tude, Bok thinks, can facilitate an increase in
 happiness in virtually anyone. Why? Because
 "it must be learned and practiced, since it
 requires an awareness of others and depends
 on thinking and attention." But Bok is never
 content with pat solutions or with solutions
 that ignore moral considerations. Consider
 what Socrates was grateful for: "That he was
 born a human being, not an animal; a man, not
 a woman; and a Greek, not a barbarian."
 Exploring Happiness is an intellectual feast.
 Its pleasures include glimpses of the lives and
 views of such figures as the Stoic Seneca, who
 served and then quit the service of the evil
 emperor Nero, hoping but ultimately failing to
 escape with his life. Or Teilhard de Chardin, the
 French Jesuit priest and scientist who felt that
 a zest for life along with a spiritual disposition
 came with an unsought collateral compensa-
 tion-happiness. Bok's book brings together
 Western thinking about happiness across time
 and geography. It is an invitation to turn to per
sonal writing and reflection and to past thinkers
 from Goethe to the Swedish feminist Ellen Key,
 who thought that happiness was the process of
 developing our capabilities. Exploring Happi-
 ness explores not only happiness but the ques-
 tion of how we should live our lives.
 Girl Power
 The enigma who ruled her world
 REVIEW BY  GELAREH ASAYESH
 CLEOPATRA: A Life
 By Stacy Schiff, Little, Brown, 368 pp., $29.99
 The cover of Stacy Schiffs newest biogra-
 phy, Cleopatra: A Life, shows a woman adorned
 in pearls, her face hidden from the viewer.
 Despite being burdened with "one of the busiest
 afterlives in history"- there is a video game
 named for her, as well as an asteroid and a cig-
 arette-very little is known for certain about
 this most famous Egyptian queen, whose four
 children were fathered by two of the most pow-
 erful men of the era: Julius Caesar and Mark
 Antony. We do not know, for example, who her
 mother was, how long Cleopatra spent in Rome,
 how often she was pregnant, whether she actu-
 ally married Mark Antony, how she died. We
 don't even know if she was beautiful- the most
 accurate rendering of history's favorite femme
 fatale is a gold coin minted during her reign,
 likely approved by her, depicting a hook-nosed,
 large-eyed woman.
 It is a safe bet that she was extraordinarily
 well educated (Plutarch says she spoke nine lan-
 guages), fabulously wealthy (she handed out
 ships and gold to her lovers), and uncommonly
 gifted in the social graces. Cicero, who detested
 the queen, also described her as one who could
 "make others laugh in spite of themselves."
 Schiff posits a childhood spent playing with ter-
 racotta dolls and pet mice and acknowledges,
 with an honesty lacking in her historical sources,
 the limits of her powers as a biographer. Author
 of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Véra (Mrs.
 Vladimir Nabokov), as well as books on Ben-
 jamin Franklin and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,
 Schiff has earned a

 chronicle the life of Cleopatra, however, she
 faced insurmountable challenges. These she
 enumerates early on in the book: the most pro-
 lific sources on Cleopatra are biased and con-
 tradictory; no papyri survive from Cleopatra's
 Alexandria, now largely buried; in fact, only one
 word survives from the last great Egyptian
 ruler- ginesthoi, Greek for "let it be done"- and
 it may have been written by a scribe. Accept-
 ing the impossibility of filling in the blanks at a
 remove of more than 2,000 years, Schiff has
 instead "corralled the possibilities." The result
 is a narrative that never quite hits its stride and
 is plagued by such absurdities as a lovingly ren-
 dered trip up the Nile, immortalized by Shake-
 speare, which may or may not have occurred.
 "On shore the date trees hung thick with fruit,
 the palm fronds slightly faded
 season; above their heads, the pigeons visibly
 paired off."
 At the end of more than 300 pages of lovely
 prose, we have learned that fried mice were
 thought to cure the pangs of teething, that 170
 rowers probably conveyed the queen across the
 Mediterranean, that pearls dissolve only very
 slowly in vinegar, that her name means "Glory
 of Her Fatherland," but Cleopatra still does not
 have a face. For this Schiff herself is at least
 partly to blame. Even as she doggedly disman-
 tles the myths that grew like kudzu around the
 Egyptian queen, she builds new ones- of female
 power and potency, Cleopatra's canny leader-
 ship, and her place at the center of world affairs,
 which, Schiff acknowledges, was fleeting at best.
 In actual fact, Cleopatra appears to have been
 as adept at losing power as she was at regain-
 ing it, beginning and ending her rule with mis-
 steps that testified to a somewhat erratic
 brilliance. Nor does her story need gilding.
 Twice dethroned, she rose twice to ever greater
 power, through the agency of the very men who
 would have deposed her. At her death, "Queen
 Cleopatra, the Goddess, the Younger, Father-
 loving and Fatherland-loving" ruled most
 of the Eastern Mediterranean coast, and if
 she handed out gold and ships along with her

 in exchange. Like them, she had a habit of ruth-
 lessly murdering her rivals. She was the prod
uct of a tempestuous age rife with beheadings,
 poisonings, stranglings, and rending of limbs.
 If she was a sexual adventuress, her exploits
 pale in comparison to Caesar's and Antony's,
 who each had four wives, none of them Cleopa
tra, and innumerable bedmates, a few of whom
 may have been men. Schiff describes Cleopa-
 tra's 22-year reign as a brief reprieve from the
 Roman tide sweeping across the Mediter-
 ranean. After the queen's death at age 39, Egypt
 became a Roman province, regaining auton-
 omy only in the 20th century. A less obvious
 legacy was Cleopatra's impact on Roman cul-
 ture: after his Alexandrian sojourn, for exam-
 ple, Caesar reformed the Roman calendar,
 modeling it after Egypfs.
 Although the historical gaps prove unbridge-
 able, Schiff has a great deal to teach us about
 Cleopatra. Despite adopting the official title
 "Cleopatra VII," she was not the seventh but the
 sixth. She was also not Egyptian but Greek, her

 Ptolemaic dynasty having been founded by one
 of Alexander the Greaťs generals. Born 69 years
 before the birth of Christ, she was a contem
porary of King Herod and, like him, given to
 murdering her kin. The second of three daugh-
 ters, followed by two brothers, she is believed
 to have dispatched her three living siblings, two
 of whom were also her husbands. Murder and
 incest were a family tradition: Schiff offers as
 an example Ptolemy VIII, who raped his niece
 Cleopatra III while married to her mother, killed
 their 14-year-old son, chopped him up, and
 delivered the pieces to his mother as a birthday
 present. Later the couple reconciled.
 Cleopatra was also the richest person in the
 Mediterranean. It was this wealth that brought
 the military might of a succession of greedy
 Romans to bear on Egypt. Cleopatra success
fully allied herself with two of them- Caesar
 and Antony- but the third, Octavian, who would
 go on to become the Roman Emperor Augus-
 tus, ended her reign and killed her firstborn son,
 fathered by Caesar. It was he, writes Schiff, who
 repackaged Cleopatra for history as the harlot
 queen of Mark Antony's undoing. If male his-
 torians have sought to diminish Cleopatra's
 power by emphasizing her sexuality, Schiff tends
 in the opposite direction, going so far as sug
gesting that Cleopatra may have been a virgin

when, at the age of 21, she was smuggled into
 Caesar's presence in a sack of hemp or leather.
 Schiff 's reasoning? Cleopatra's brother, who was
 also her consort, was 13 and hence unlikely to
 have reached puberty. The implicit suggestion
 is that, until she met Caesar, Cleopatra was a
 faithful wife. But within months of meeting Cae-
 sar, she was pregnant with his child- his only
 issue- and had replaced her brother as Egypt's
 ruler. Caesar himself writes in his memoirs that
 he supported Cleopatra's claim to the throne
 because she was loyal. In contrast to her chron-
 iclers' embellishments, references to Cleopatra
 by her lovers were both few and remarkably dis-
 passionate. In a letter to his fellow triumvir and
 erstwhile drinking buddy Octavian, Mark
 Antony asks why the fuss over his "screwing the
 queen
 whom you get it up?" Cleopatra was, after all,
 not the only queen that Caesar and Mark Antony
 bedded in the course of their sexual-political
 conquest of the ancient world.
 Whether or not, as Plutarch claimed, Cleopa-
 tra resorted to a hunger strike to keep Mark
 Antony from returning to Rome, he did divorce
 Octavia, his Roman wife, to make his home in
 Alexandria. At the height of his discord with
 Octavian, he and Cleopatra held a ceremony
 conferring lavish titles and lands upon their
 three children. Given the state of affairs in
 Rome, Mark Antony might be said to have been
 asking for what he got: mass defections to his
 rival, defeat on land and at sea, death by his own
 hand. This section of the book is vivid and
 romantic. Having registered her doubts about
 Plutarch and Dio as accurate chroniclers of
 the Antony-Cleopatra story, Schiff surrenders
 to their version of events in which Mark Antony
 dies in Cleopatra's arms. The queen commits
 suicide as well, leaving her children to be raised
 by the scorned Octavia, half sister of Octavian.
 Octavian then founds an empire and rules for
 44 years- ample time to rewrite history.
 There can be little doubt that we have fallen
 victim to his efforts, yet one could wish that
 Schiff did not yield so much narrative ground
 to resitting historical uncertainties. Stripped of
 its fabulous trappings, Cleopatra's tale is one of
 enduring geopolitical realities, the story of a
 Middle Eastern monarch doing what she could
 to protect her sovereignty and her national
 resources from the superior military might of
 the West. As a tribute to female power, Cleopa-
 tra is an ironic one. As Schiff notes, her dis-
 tinction lies in the power she possessed to barter
 herself directly, rather than being pimped by
 her male relatives. In the idiom of our own time,
 Cleopatra's story is about the ultimate power
 couple. As such it raises fascinating questions
 about where politics ends and love begins. Does
 Hillary Clinton love Bill and vice versa? Did
 Cleopatra, who had viable political prospects
 long after her lover's were exhausted, stick with

 Mark Antony out of loyalty or despondency?
 Schiff, earnestly explaining why the Egyp-
 tian queen is unlikely to have been killed by the
 sting of an asp hidden in a basket of figs (too big
 to hide among figs, too painful to be her first
 choice, too sluggish to kill Cleopatra's atten-
 dants as well as the queen herself), does not
 waste time pondering these imponderables. Her
 Cleopatra is more complex than Plutarch's,
 Livy's, and Appian's, yet simpler than she
 deserves. Shakespeare got it right when he wrote
 of Cleopatra: "Age cannot wither her, nor cus-
 tom stale / Her infinite variety." He, of course,
 was wise enough to eschew fact for fiction.
 Despite the obstacles in her path, we are fortu-
 nate that Schiff has not done the same.

 Visitors to the capitol will find no bust of

 given that Crazy Horse proved far less pliable

 Sitting Bull, who toured with Buffalo Bill's Wild

 then, of course, there is the uncomfortable mat-

C.'s new biography of the formidable Arsinoë II in Oxford's Women in Antiquity series
adds to new, focused studies on Hellenistic queens, along with D. Roller's portrait of
Cleopatra VII and D. dayman's newly-published Berenice II. The aim of these mono-
graphs is to offer 'compact and accessible' introductions to notable women from antiquity.
C., author of Women and Monarchy in Ancient Macedonia (2000) and numerous other
studies on Hellenistic royal women and courts, is well suited to take on this figure
whose career spanned the formative years of the early-Hellenistic Macedonian and
Ptolemaic courts. The result is a very useful compilation of the sources and bibliography
on Arsinoë and a clear and judicious overview of this important figure.
After a brief introduction, a chapter on Arsinoë' s background and youth is followed by
two chapters on her ill-fated marriages in Thrace and Macedonia, first to Lysimachus and
then to her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos. Chapters 4 and 5 treat Arsinoë' s marriage to
her brother Ptolemy Philadelphus. A final chapter is dedicated to Arsinoë's 'afterlife'.
An appendix appraises the extant literary sources and provides an overview of secondary
scholarship.
The source material for Arsinoë's life is difficult and very fragmentary, and some of the
methodological observations of the thorough appendix would have been better placed at
the front of the book. The main historical source, Justin's Epitome of Pompeius Trogus,
is very late and internally inconsistent, and the rest of the scattered literary sources only
allow us to sketch her life in the broadest outline. As C. rightly notes, this problem has
led to vastly different interpretations of her character and role in the politics of the
Macedonian and Ptolemaic courts. These range from Bevan's memorable 'tigress', followed
in large part by early authorities like Tarn and Macurdy, to S. Burstein' s important
reassessment
('Arsinoé II Philadelphos: a Revisionist View' in Philip II, Alexander the
Great
and the Macedonian Heritage [1982]) that challenged this portrait and the notion
that
Ptolemy II was an ineffectual puppet, and subsequent studies further reducing her
role in politics. As such, understanding the limitations of the sources is essential for mounting
a convincing reconstruction of Arsinoë. The reason this material is relegated to the
book's sole appendix, I imagine, is to increase the text's accessibility as an introductory
biography. This raises the crucial question of the intended audience of the book and the
feasibility of writing a 'biography' in the modern sense of a figure so poorly known.
The book is admirably approachable, but still assumes enough background that it is not
exactly for a 'general audience'. In particular undergraduates would certainly benefit
from greater insight into the methodology of ancient history.
A particular strength of C.'s treatment is a focus on Arsinoë's circle of philoi and partisans.
C. helps the reader vividly imagine the world of the Macedonian court, riven by
factionalism
between rival wives and potential heirs, and their supporters. C. emphasises
this background and employs it to address some of the lacunae of the sources.
However, periodic, but too frequent, speculations such as '[Arsinoë] could have been a
controlled, even repressed young woman thanks to the tense situation in which she had
grown up' (p. 32) detract from what is otherwise a main point of the book - that our cultural
categories are not those of the ancients and we should not impose them on our

interpretation of royal women. Similarly hypothetical suggestions, such as the notion that
Arsinoë II may have actually 'brought up' (p. 68) Arsinoë I after the death of the latter' s
mother, not only lack any evidentiary basis, but can give the reader a false impression - in
this case that the royal Macedonian family was in some way similar to the modern nuclear
family.
One chapter of Arsinoë' s life in Macedonia that is more fully treated by the ancient
sources is her role in the execution of Lysimachus' son Agathocles and her marriage to
Ptolemy Keraunos. Here the sources are unsatisfactory, and C. ably shows how they
play on topoi of female behaviour. Regarding the murder of Agathocles, C. does plausibly
emphasise the importance of the arrival of Ptolemy Keraunos and the acquisition of
Macedonia as destabilising factors but ultimately resorts to a psychologising interpretation
of the sequence of events, stressing Arsinoë's fear for her own sons (pp. 42-3). The question
of agency remains obscure in C.'s account, and it does not explain Lysimachus' decision
to eliminate his son, a risky move that ultimately undermined his house. Dmitriev's
suggestion
that the elevation of Ptolemy II and the sudden rise in prestige of Arsinoë
and
her line were the motivating factors perhaps deserves fuller consideration ('The Last
Marriage
and the Death of Lysimachus' GRBS 47 [2007]).
The remainder of the book deals with Arsinoë's career in Egypt. As C. herself states,
her emphasis lies more on the Macedonian background than the Egyptian dimension of
Ptolemaic kingship. Due to the difficulty of the material, a more comprehensive guide
to the complex literature on the Egyptian 'face' of the Ptolemaic monarchy would be help-
ful. Arsinoë of course stands at the centre of the intractable issue of brother-sister marriage
in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt. C.'s treatment of this issue belongs to the school that minimises
the scale of Greek discomfort with this practice (p. 74). She also downplays the role
of
Egyptian precedent and suggests the preference for extreme endogamy was a response to
the
problems of polygamy, an inwardness already signalled by Ptolemy I (pp. 76-7) and
prefigured
by her marriage to her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos (pp. 58-64). Neither
proposition
is fully convincing. Sibling marriage has been a topic of perennial interest,
but
it has recently been the subject of renewed scholarly attention and extremely divergent
opinion.
C. takes full account of the new literature in her bibliography, but does not offer
the
reader a systematic appraisal of the evidence and various scholarly arguments, thereby
giving
little indication of why she favours her interpretation. There is also a tendency
towards
somewhat circular argumentation that crops up elsewhere in the text - sibling marriage
would become a hallmark of the Ptolemaic dynasty so this explains Ptolemy's gamble.
This itself is overstated. The next sibling marriage was two generations later in 221 and
thereafter it was still only sporadic.
C. provides a sensitive overview of the difficult question of Arsinoë's political influ-
ence as queen. However, as the only contemporary literary sources, the discussion of
the works of the Alexandrian poets as reflection of Ptolemaic imperial discourse is surprisingly
brief. On the subject of Arsinoë's death and cult, the new publication of P. Sorb. 71
(Cadell
et al., Papyrus de la Sorbonne (P. Sorb. III nos 70-144) [201 1]) adds detail, demonstrating
that Arsinoë died between 27 June and 26 July 270 and not in 268, that the
appointment
of a kanephoros for Arsinoë's cult began already in 269 and finally that
Ptolemy
'the Son' became co-regent with Ptolemy II earlier than is usually assumed,
i.e. in 268/7 rather than 267/6.
Most of the discussion of the material culture relating to Arsinoë (coinage, portraiture,
cult) is relegated to the final chapter on her 'afterlife'. Despite the fact that much of this
was or may have been posthumous, it still represents the largest contemporary or nearcontemporary
body of primary evidence on Arsinoë and her role in the formative period
of
Ptolemaic self-representation and might have been more effectively incorporated into

the previous chapters. The question of the image of Arsinoë and its long-lived importance
to the Ptolemaic monarchy is complex, and again non-specialist readers would benefit from
a fuller discussion of the issues and more complete footnotes. Fuliñska's recent treatment
of the iconography of the Ptolemaic queens on coinage can be added to C.'s bibliography
( Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization 14 [2010]) along with Albersmeier's study of the
portrait statues of the Ptolemaic queens ( Untersuchungen zu den Frauenstatuen des
ptolemäischen Ägypten [2002]). Finally, a more substantial conclusion would have been
a valuable asset.
Despite these concerns, this is a valuable book. Arsinoë has long merited an accessible
monographic treatment in English, and this balanced study is a good starting point for anyone
interested in the Hellenistic royal families, the Macedonian and Ptolemaic courts, or
women
in antiquity in general. It is an important addition to a much-needed series.

B. continues his contribution to the study of Egyptian religion in this new work. Differing
from previous studies, the book examines the main topics concerning the cult of Isis,
accessible by those without an extensive background in Isis studies. Similar in some
respects to B.'s previously published Bibliotheca Isiaca I (2008), much of the work is
devoted to the study of material culture, relying extensively on examples from his
Recueil des inscriptions concernant les cultes isiaques (RICIS), published in 2005.
The title does not indicate the study's true range, which is not only devoted to the worship
of Isis but incorporates other deities included within her pantheon, such as Osiris. The
book
proceeds along broad thematic lines: Part 1 offers a cursory overview of Isis' divine
pantheon;
Part 2 the cult's diffusion; Part 3 issues of the cult's reception and integration;
Part
4 cult places; Part 5 cultic participants; Part 6 rites and practices of the cult; and Part 7
the
many terms and iconography associated with the cult. Each section consists of multiple
subsections
including a page-long introduction into the topic followed by select examples
drawn
from literary, epigraphic and archaeological sources and concluding bibliographical
suggestions.
In the introduction, B. outlines a selective historiography of previous Isis research,
which is especially helpful in illustrating how such studies have guided past interpretations
of the cult and provides the foundation for the topics addressed in his book. Part 1 begins
with a brief examination of the main components of Isis' divine pantheon. B. evaluates the
literary and iconographie image of Isis as well as the origins of Serapis (pp. 31-41). The
primary deities associated with Isis including Harpocrate, Anubis, Apis, Boubastis and
Osiris are examined in combination with limited literary, epigraphic and archaeological
examples. While not overly extensive, the examples given provide a general account of
the cult and a starting point for any future study.
The long second part examines the cult's diffusion, a topic with a considerable amount
of surviving material evidence. Proceeding beyond the diffusion of Isis, B. also considers

Ancient Egypt in 101 Questions and Answers. By ThOmas schNeIder, translated by davId LOrTON.
Ithaca:
cOrNeLL uNIversITy press, 2013. Pp. xiv + 282, illus. $26.
Thomas Schneider tackles 101 questions about ancient Egypt, loosely organized into thematic
categories including history, religion, society, and worldview. With a book of this nature, a series of
issues comes to the fore: what drives the selection of questions? How well does it serve its intended
audience, and how widely does it appeal? Does it have uses for a specialist reader as a reference or as
a teaching tool?
The intended audience and selection of questions are briefly addressed in the author’s preface, in
which Schneider states that the volume aims to “introduce readers to ancient Egypt and invite them
to further study” (p. xiii). Questions were chosen for the frequency with which they are asked or their
potential to provide intriguing and provocative insights into ancient Egypt (ibid.). The resulting mix
is quite variable in scope, and the appeal of the question-and-answer format depends largely on each
reader’s purpose in approaching the book. Some of the 101 questions will resonate with faculty who
have heard their own students, from across disciplines and backgrounds, ask variations of these queries:
Is there anything left to discover in Egypt (questions 20 and 26)? Were Egyptians obsessed with death
(question 22)? And where were Egypt’s cities (question 58)? It can be useful for teachers to reflect
anew on these topics and consider Schneider’s answers as they formulate their own.
Others will sound familiar to any who have written (and subsequently graded) essay questions for
introductory-level Egyptology exams. “Why is the Middle Kingdom considered to be the ‘classical’
period of ancient Egypt?” (question 31) and “What does the phrase ‘grammar of the temple’ mean?”
(question 41) are queries that would likely not occur to a lay audience, though they do seem like a convenient
reference
for
undergraduates
cramming
for
their
midterm
examination.
Scholars
may
well
find

themselves
drawn in by some of the more
unexpected topics, such as Egyptology’s
role
in the Third
Reich
(question
9)
and
the
effect
of
landscape
and
environment
on
culture
change
(question
19).
At
one

to
three
pages each, the answers are
too brief to be of substantial academic use, but they do serve the useful
function
of
suggesting
areas
of
inquiry
and
directing
the
reader
onto
a
path
to
further
investigation.
Several questions will likely be of interest to those who have no background in ancient Egypt but
who wonder about its lasting influence—the pyramid on the American dollar bill, for example (question
3)—or
whether
the
Egyptians
shared
our
view
of
the
cosmos
(question
14).
For
readers
who
have

an
interest
in
comparative
religion
or
who
may
have
faith-based
questions,
Schneider
addresses
ancient

Egypt’s
intersection
with
Judaism
(question
5),
Mormonism
(question
6),
the
Messiah
(question
37),

and
the
early
rivalry
between
Christianity
and
pre-Christian
Egyptian
religion
(question
7).
The volume’s strongest entries are those that address fundamental issues in Egyptology or provide
a window into a larger and fascinating aspect of society. Questions such as “When did ancient Egypt’s 
history begin?” (question 23) and “When did ancient Egypt end?” (question 24) are deceptively tricky, 
as any instructor designing an introductory Egyptian history course has discovered. Where to begin the
story of ancient Egypt and where to end it are matters of debate, and Schneider provides a balanced
and reasoned argument to carry our consideration of ancient Egypt into the late fourth century
c.e.

A valuable aspect of this volume lies in those questions that resist an easy answer and will always 
be up for debate. Issues such as the most decisive turning point in Egyptian history (question 28), 
the most significant religious concept (question 39), and the most important architectural monument
and recent excavation (questions 55 and 56) would likely elicit as many different answers as there are
professional Egyptologists. From this perspective, it is interesting to note Schneider’s choices, as we
compare his answers with our own.
The volume’s weaknesses can be categorized according to structure, content, and presentation.
Structurally, the chief flaw is the lack of a useful introductory note or a progression of information that
would guide the non-specialist reader. Although the preface suggests that the content is aimed at an
introductory level, the questions do not progress in a sequence that would serve to introduce a reader to
ancient Egypt. Question 1, a natural starting point, does not stand out as one of the more approachable
essays. Aside from the somewhat technical discussion of calculating solar calendars, this first essay
uses phrases and terminology that would not necessarily be accessible to a general reader with little
background in ancient Egypt. Names and phrases such as Naqada II culture, Ptolemy III, and Canopus
Decree are used without any explanation other than a corresponding date, which is insufficient contextualization
for a casual reader.
This is compounded by the fact that the entire
first section of the

book,
“Ancient
Egypt
and
the
Modern
World”
(pp.
3–27),
lacks
an
overall
organizational
structure
that

would
facilitate
a
reader’s
engagement.
Topics
range
from
the
aforementioned
solar
calendar
to
Afrocentrism,
the
Romantic
poets
Byron
and
Shelley,
and
twentieth-century
Egyptian
nationalism.
Though

potentially
interesting
in their own right, collectively
they do not succeed in introducing
fundamental

concepts
that
might
give
the
general
reader
the
tools
to
engage
with
the
full
range
of
101
questions.
In some cases, the answers are unsatisfying; questions 48 and 100 are examples of those that fall
short of their potential. “Why did the Egyptians mummify their dead” (question 48) is followed by
an explanation of mummification techniques and their change over time, and aside from a passing
reference to funerary religion and nourishment, there is no direct answer to the why of mummification.
Given the acknowledgement that mummification looms large in the public consciousness (p. 141),
this would have been an opportunity to balance Hollywood’s portrayal of the grotesque, zombie-like
mummy with the Egyptian belief in the continued existence of the soul and the Egyptians’ positive
associations of the mummified body as an image of the deceased, rather than a corpse.
In answer to question 100, “Who is the most famous Egyptologist,” Schneider provides a summary
of fictional Egyptologists—from the lead character in Stargate to recent pieces of historical fiction—
rather than noting the most significant individuals in Egyptology’s actual development over the past
two centuries. Elsewhere Schneider provides useful reviews of aspects of Egyptology as a discipline,
including a concise summary of the academic literature on Egyptian religion (question 38). Question
100 is a missed opportunity to summarize the fascinating and real cast of characters that have contributed
to
Egyptology’s
history.
With regard to presentation, the volume lacks both an index and a list of questions. Without these 
two features, and given the first section’s minimal usefulness as an introduction to ancient Egypt, general
readers
cannot
easily
decide
where
best
to
begin
their
engagement
with
the
content.

for sites and geographic features are tiny and pixelated to the point of illegibility, rendering them of
little use to anyone who is not already familiar with their names.
In conclusion, the wide-ranging assortment of topics and the question-and-answer format will likely
appeal to the casual reader who does not look for structure or background information on ancient
Egypt. It may also be useful to a specialist who wishes to gather fresh ideas for teaching material; it
provides a window into the types of questions that occur to students but are perhaps forgotten by those
who have spent years in specialized study. Certain topics are indeed intriguing, and for those who
find themselves teaching, lecturing, or writing for the general public, it is worth perusing Schneider’s
answers to some of the fundamental questions of Egyptology.

The present volume, product of a conference held in November 2011 at the University of Wrocław,
in cooperation with Helmut-Schmidt University (Hamburg), is an interdisciplinary foray into Alexander’s
short
stay
in
Egypt
and
his
legacy
in
Egyptian
culture.
Consisting
of
twenty-two
contributions

(excluding
the
introduction),
the
aim
of
the
volume,
according
to
the
editors,
is
“to
look
at
the
Macedonian
king through
the Egyptian
eye,”
using
Egyptian
and
other
non-classical evidence
as a way to

“assess
the
depth
(or
shallowness)
of
the
Greek
veneer
in
Egypt
in
the
age
of
the
Argead
rulers”
(p.
8).

Though
contributions
are
mainly
in
English,
German
and
French
are
also
represented.
Naturally,
there

are
hazards
in
compiling
a
volume
with
such
international
character;
both
the
quality
of
the
editing
and

the
argumentation
of
each
chapter
are
of
inconsistent
nature,
though
that
is
not
to
diminish
the
importance
of
several
scholarly
contributions
throughout
the
work.
Though the volume is organized in a roughly chronological way (beginning with Argead strategic
interest in Egypt and ending with several contributions on the Medieval Alexander Romance), the editors
have
missed
an
opportunity
for
what
could
have
been
a
more
meaningful
thematic
approach.
For

instance,
multiple
authors
address
the
question
of
chronology,
Alexander’s
legitimation
as
pharaoh

(with
heavy focus on the oracle at Siwa),
the foundation of Alexandria and other important building
projects
throughout
Egypt,
his death and burial, the behavior of the Diadochoi, and Alexander’s

reception/legacy.
One
of
the
most
important
threads
throughout
the
volume
is
the
almost
uniform

insistence
on
the
continuity
of
Egyptian
(especially
dynastic)
custom
as
a
major
element
in
Alexander’s

campaign.
Due
to
constrictions
of
space,
I
will
not
focus
on
all
of
the
contributions
in
the
volume,
but

highlight
a
few
outstanding
or
controversial
pieces.
As previously mentioned, as a fascinating piece of reception literature, The Alexander Romance
naturally plays a great role in several studies in this book. Wojciechowska and Nawotka (“Alexander in
Egypt: Chronology”) take this work (which, they argue, uniquely preserves a local tradition that does
not follow the conventional line of Alexander historians) into account, in order to establish a chronology
for
Alexander’s
Egyptian
campaign.
They
settle
on
a
coronation
date
that preceded the
foundation

of
Alexandria in spring of 331
B.c.
In another contribution, “Alexander
the Great
kosmokrator,”
the

same
authors argue that the appellation of Alexander as kosmokrator,
also evident
in The
Romance,

originates
from
an Egyptian
notion of “ruler of the world.”
Their argument is buttressed
by the fact

that this epithet is attested only in Egyptian contexts or sources originating in Egypt (e.g., Manetho). 
The transmission of the idea, the authors suggest, would have occurred in the milieu of Hellenized
Egyptians in the Ptolemaic period. Aleksandra Szalc studies a visit to a Nubian queen’s castle in The
Romance to develop her argument for a literary conflation of Indian and African elements in its description.
This, she argues, is part of a topos
meant
to underline the totality of Alexander’s world
domination

(much
as
can
also
be
found
in
Achaemenid
inscriptions,
most
famously
at
Bisitun).

 Power and Gender
 in Ancient Egypt:
 The Case of Hatshepsut
 BY KRISTINA HILLIARD AND KATE WURTZEL
 Recommended for Grades 7-9
 Introduction
 Hatshepsut (1479-1458 B.C.E) ruled New Kingdom Egypt for roughly 20 years as one of the
 few female pharaohs in the history of ancient Egypt. Her rule began when her husband died
 and her stepson was too young to be pharaoh. Hatshepsut had to defy the typical feminine
 visual representations used by queens before her in order to establish herself as a king. To legitimize
 her role as pharaoh, Hatshepsut began a significant building campaign by constructing numerous
 images, temples, and obelisks, and by leading military expeditions. Visual representations of
 Hatshepsut range from depictions of her as a female king, physically female in form adorning phara
 onic male accoutrements,1 to images of her as a physically male king with a mans chest and build.
 This Instructional Resource will address issues of how gender and power can be manipulated through
 works of art and architecture in relationship to Hatshepsut s reign as pharaoh.
 Objectives
 During this lesson, and in relationship to their study of
 Hatshepsut and her role in Egyptian history, students will:
 explore Egyptian sculpture and architecture to understand
 how they were used to glorify rulers;
 investigate image, structure, symbol, and composition to
 construct meanings associated with gender, authority, and
 position; and
 demonstrate how art and the design of environments are
 utilized to empower self and others.
 Historical Context
 Although motherhood was considered the pinnacle of a
 woman's achievement in ancient Egyptian society, women, typi
 cally upper-class and royal, were still allowed to be educated, to
 own property and businesses, to obtain a job, and to be involved
 in military leadership (Depla, 1994). More importantly, women
 could rule as pharaoh. This was a rare occurrence, yet it did
 happen.
 Hatshepsut's husband, Thutmose II, died early in his reign,
 leaving his young son, Thutmose III, the son of the king's second

 wife Isis, as the pharaoh of Egypt. Because Thutmose III was too
 young to rule, his stepmother Hatshepsut became his regent, his
 council to rule in his place until he was of age. Her father was the
 previous king and so she was Thutmose Ills closest relative of
 royal birth (Robins, 1983). Soon after, Hatshepsut assumed the
 throne claiming herself king and began constructing sculptures
 and architectural environments depicting her divine birth and
 emphasizing her right to be king (Roehrig, Dreyfus, 8c Keller,
 2005).
 During her reign, representations of Hatshepsut changed. In the
 beginning of her role as regent, Hatshepsut portrayed herself as
 a queen, with physically female characteristics and traditional
 queenly insignia. Soon after, Hatshepsut began depicting herself
 in dual-gendered imagery, as a queen with kingly characteristics.
 Later, Hatshepsut began representing herself in a physically male
 form reminiscent of a canonical pharaoh (Roehrig, Dreyfus, &
 Keller, 2005). In effect, Hatshepsut was slowly addressing the
 intersections of gender and kingship, cultivating a new pharaonic
 identity.
 About the Art: The Power of An Image
 In ancient Egypt, literacy was rare, found mainly among the
 upper- and elite classes of society. Imagery thus functioned to
 educate and was used by the state as propaganda. Visual repre
 sentations such as monuments, sculpture, and reliefs were used to
 persuade the public to follow the king and to understand that the
 king had the divine right to rule. These objects taught the public
 that they should revere the king and be dutiful.
 The role of the pharaoh in ancient Egypt was father and god of
 the land of Egypt. A kings image accompanied by godly symbols
 was used to legitimize the king s power, transforming him into
 a god. Traditional kings displayed themselves as powerful males
 with symbols of both male and femaleness, symbols connected
 to gods and goddesses (Troy, 2003). Hatshepsut's images depart
 from the canon of traditional kingly imagery. Hatshepsut's images
 shifted from one gender to another, but also displayed aspects of
 what may be considered androgyny, meaning that they evoked
 both gender identities together. For example, when she was
 represented as a female king, she wore male accoutrements such
 as the nemes headdress, a cloth folded over the head and tucked
 behind the ears. Furthermore, traditional pharaonic imagery also
 depicts the pharaoh with his principal wife,2 symbolizing the role
 of the royal couple as the mother and father of Egypt. However,
 Hatshepsut was predominantly depicted alone, since she did not
 have a partner to establish her power to the throne. Instead, she
 used aspects of androgyny to include both genders in her imagery,
 conveying the idea that she was both mother and father of Egypt
 by herself. Hatshepsut is the first female king to depict herself in
 this way, and in doing so, she began to gain the acceptance of the
 Egyptian people (Roehrig, Dreyfus, 8c Keller, 2005).

 of Art, Rogers Fund, 1929 (29.3.3). Torso lent by Rijksmuseum van Oudheden,
 Leiden (LI 998.80). Image ?The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 In Hatshepsut as a Female King, Hatshepsut is portrayed as a
 female. She wears a wide collar and a sheer dress, where her
 breasts and feminine curves are shown to advantage. In addition,
 she shows off bracelets and anklets. These displays are typical
 of traditional queenly imagery of ancient Egypt (Robins, 1996).
 However, unlike traditional queens, she wears the pharaonic
 nemes headdress and uraeus adornment, a cobra on the front of
 the headdress. The uraeus is a phallic form associated with the
 sun god (Troy, 2003). The statue also includes two carved images
 of the goddess Taweret. This goddess was associated with the
 protection of women during childbirth, and links Hatshepsut
 to divine birth. According to Roehrig, Dreyfus, & Keller (2005),
 this life-sized statue is not idealized but an individual portrait of
 Hatshepsut, portraying her power and authority to those who
 view the sculpture. Although both female and male characteristics
 are part of the image, the work focuses on the feminine.
 Hatshepsut further broke with tradition by representing herself
 as a man. In Hatshepsut Offers Maat to Amun, Hatshepsut is
 depicted as a male king, who wears the nemes headdress and
 adorns a traditional male wrap. Her torso is uncovered and
 reveals the chest of a man. She also wears the pharaonic beard.
 She is kneeling and offering jars of maat4 to Amun5, a kingly
 temple ritual. Maat is the fundamental order of the universe
 without which all of creation would perish. It was the primary
 duty of the pharaoh to uphold this order by maintaining the law
 and administering justice. Because Hatshepsut is depicted as
 offering maat to Amun, she is displayed as the rightful, dutiful
 king fulfilling her role as pharaoh. The large, open eyes and the
 small, thin nose are similar to that found in her female image.
 She is, however, much more stylized in the fashion of canonical
 representations of ancient Egyptian kings. For all intents and
 purposes, she is a male king, her true identity only discernible
 by inscriptions on the statue, describing her as a "lady of the two
 lands" (Roehrig, Dreyfus, & Keller, 2005).
 To further promote her power and political agenda, Hatshepsut
 built the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut located at Deir El-Bahri
 in western Thebes, the capital city of ancient Egypt. Statues of
 Hatshepsut, including a colossal one as a traditional male king,
 relief images of Hatshepsut as a sphinx trampling her enemies,
 and narrative scenes of particular historical events were displayed
 throughout the temple. Moreover, shrines dedicated to various
 deities were also placed inside the temple in order to legitimize
 Hatshepsufs divine power and right to rule. Hatshepsut placed
 her temple next to that of Mentuhotep Us (2051-2000 B.C.E.),
 a powerful pharaoh during the Eleventh Dynasty who reunited
 Egypt and founded the second golden age of Egyptian history.
 This placement, as well as the use of colonnaded porticoes, ramps,
 and terraces, was purposeful and emphasized her reign as another
 golden age for Egypt (Roehrig, Dreyfus, & Keller, 2005).

 Discussion of Artworks
 After presenting a brief biographical sketch of Hatshepsut and ancient
 Egypt, ask students to discuss their understanding of Egyptian kings
 and queens, describing how they might envision them and what they
 would wear or build to convey power and identity. Present the two
 images of Hatshepsut and the image of the temple and have students
 compare the images, looking specifically at the different masculine or
 feminine qualities found in her portraits and the power conveyed by
 her temple. While comparing the works of art, explain the different
 accoutrements, address the function of the sculptures and temple
 monument, and inquire about their possible message.
 Suggested discussion questions include the following:
 What are the similarities and differences between the sculptures?
 Would you know that these are images of a pharaoh?
 Why or why not?
 How is the pharaoh's power conveyed by the sculptures?
 The architecture?
 What do you think about her portrayal as a male pharaoh? Did it
 or did it not enhance her position in ancient Egyptian society?
 What do you think about her portrayal as a female? Did it or did
 it not enhance her position in ancient Egyptian society?
 Relating the Art to Issues Today
 Reveal to the students how the transition of Hatshepsut s images was
 tied to her identity and evolution as a king in ancient Egypt. Discuss
 how she was able to convince the public of her right to the kingship
 because of her images and building campaign. To relate the work to
 students* lives, ask your pupils to explore their own understanding of
 what it means to be male and female today. Have students consider
 how imagery and symbols in today's society construct ideas about
 femaleness and maleness. In addition, ask students to think about
 how they use objects and images to project a sense of identity and
 power. You may also want to compare Hatshepsut's temple with
 contemporary architectural structures, such as the White House, and
 how they convey power.
 Suggested discussion questions include the following:
 What does it mean to be female or male in today's society?
 How do you know what it means to be a female or male today?
 Can you think of any visual signs, symbols, or architectural
 structures, which contribute to your understanding of what it
 means to be a female or male in todays society?
 Can you think of any visual signs, symbols, or architectural
 structures that might contribute to your understanding of what it
 means to have power in todays society?
 How do you contribute to ideas about gender or power through
 your everyday actions?
 Activity I: Personal Power
 For this activity, students will begin to develop an understanding
 about Hatshepsuts public use of gendered imagery to reinforce her
 position of power. The students will determine how gender issues
 affect their lives today and their sense of personal power. Investi
 gating individual concepts of gender and identity, the students will
 reflect on when they feel powerful as a man or woman and how this
 is reinforced, or not reinforced through society and social imagery.
 The first step is asking students to think about when they feel most
 powerful. The second step is investigating how these powerful
 moments are related to gender concepts and visual imagery. Next,
 have students write four paragraphs during the class period. The
 following prompts can be used to begin the writing exercise.

 Being female in this world today means:
 Being male in this world today means:
 I feel most powerful when I:
 I feel least powerful when I:
 Studio Activity: My Public Display
 Students will create a two-dimensional mixed-media collage,
 reflecting their identity, power, and individual understandings of
 gender. Encourage students to consider the project as a work of
 public art, which they will display in an architectural environment.
 Ask students to think about any messages they wish to project about
 themselves, any ideas they wish to reinforce about gender, and a
 visual aesthetic they hope to create for their architectural structure.
 To begin, have students strike a pose that expresses a moment when
 they feel most powerful. Take pictures of each pose using a digital
 camera and upload the images onto the computer. Next, allow
 students to experiment with color combinations and value scales on
 the computer. After experimenting, print off the best five manipu
 lated images for each student. Have students transfer their favorite
 manipulated image onto canvas, cardboard, or paper, adding paint to
 construct a mixed-media collage.
 The last step is to incorporate aspects of prior classroom discussion
 into the work of art. Ask students to think back to their discussions
 and writing exercise and recall symbols, images, or structures they
 investigated during the earlier exercises. Students will then search
 through various media sources to locate similar images and integrate
 these into their portraits. Ideally these collaged symbols, objects, and
 structures will be a reflection of how students understand their place
 in society as it relates to identity, gender, and power.
 Studio Activity: My Temple, My Place
 Students will now construct a model for a temple or architectural
 structure, where their images could possibly hang if the building was
 constructed. This temple or architectural diorama should reflect the
 students' identities, their understandings of gender, and what power
 means to them. Students may bring in any size cardboard box and use
 multi media or found objects to decorate their temple. Before they

 begin to decorate their interiors, students should paint their boxes and allow
 time for them to dry. Once the boxes are dry, students may add various
 objects or images onto the walls and in the interior space of their building.
 After students have completed their temple, ask them to display their works
 along side the earlier two-dimensional images and answer the following
 questions:
 How does this building reflect who I am today or who I hope to be in
 the future?
 What message does my building send to others?
 How is my building a reflection of my identity?
 How is my building a reflection of my world or my environment?
 Would a visitor in my space understand my perspectives on gender and
 power?
 Assessment
 At the conclusion of this unit, have students write a reflection on their
 activities. Entries should address the following questions:
 Did your perception of ancient Egyptian works of art change because of
 this project, and if so how?
 How did this project help you to understand how you define femaleness,
 maleness, and power?
 How does your understanding of gender and power reinforce or
 challenge beliefs in your environment?
 How does Hatshepsut's use of gendered temple sculptures relate to you
 today?
 Conclusion
 Hatshepsut's use of dual-gendered imagery helped to construct her identity
 as pharaoh, and reminded those who walked through her temples of who
 she was. These sculptures, along with the overall reign of Hatshepsut, offer
 opportunities for students to examine ancient Egyptian artwork through the
 lens of gender and power. In addition, Hatshepsut's use of both the female
 and male identity to reinforce her position enables students to investigate
 their conceptions of femaleness, maleness, identity, and power as they are
 constructed and projected in today's society.

 Hatshepsut, the famous Egyptian queen who became
 pharaoh, ruled during the early 18th Dynasty (ca. 1479-1485
 B.C.E.) of the New Kingdom. Her career, first as regent for
 her stepson/nephew Thutmose III and her later joint rule
 with him, lasted less than 15 years, but it is a reign that is
 writ large in history. The character and motivations of this
 woman have been the issue of speculation ever since there
 was a discipline of Egyptology. In the mid 20th century, the
 usually sober Cambridge Ancient History painted her in mi
sogynistic terms as "conniving," as a "shrewd, ambitious and

unscrupulous woman," and as the "detested stepmother." Her
 assumption of full regency was characterized as "flaunting
 the royal titulary."1 Another standard reference for Egyptian
 history commented: "It is not to be imagined, however, that
 even a woman of the mostvirile character could have attained
 such a pinnacle of power without masculine support."2
 This subject is a museum director's dream: an exhibition
 about a powerful yet misunderstood woman (an Egyptian
 pharaoh to boot) , who left an incredibly rich material legacy
 and whose history is in dire need of reexamination. And who
 better to organize such an exhibition than the Metropolitan
 Museum of Art?3 The institution excavated many of her monu-
 ments and houses many of the major artifacts of her era.
 Considering the popular and scholarly interest in, and
 uncertainty about, the events of the period and the allure of
 the topic (a powerful woman, hints of a sexual relationship,
 frayed family relations) , it is surprising that it took so long for
 a major reexamination of the era to be mounted. From 1996
 to 1998, Geheimnisvolle Konigin Hatschepsut: Agyptische Kunst
 des 15.Jahrhundrets v. Chr toured Berlin, Hanover, Munich,
 and Warsaw. That exhibition consisted of 89 objects drawn
 from German and Polish museum collections. A smaller
 show, Hatschepsut Konigin Agyptens (note the clever pun in
 "Konigin") , was mounted in Munich in 1999. It was a heavily
 historical exhibit that consisted of 24 objects that, with one
 exception, came from German collections.
 Finally, we have an exhaustive presentation, the scale of
 which is characteristic of the Metropolitan Museum with its
 tremendous influence and resources. Hatshepsut: From Queen
 to Pharaoh consists of 200 objects, from small to monumental,
 drawn from collections throughout the world, including
 items from Cairo. There are few objects from the era that
 the curators did not include. This is truly an ambitious and
 ultimately successful exhibition.
 The museum's Egyptian department and its designers
 give visitors a preview of the exhibition's glories before they
 even enter the galleries. A colossal granite sphinx (fig. 1)
 from the joint reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III stands
 in the lobby, enticing museum-goers to the show.
 The exhibition is arranged in a series of nine large rooms in
 the vast Tisch galleries. The dark blue introductory chamber
 highlights a sole spectacular object: a granite statue of the
 queen in her guise as king (cat. no. 94). The wall text gives
 historical background on Hatshepsut, on that period in Egypt
 ("the pyramids were more than one thousand years old") , and
 on female kings in other eras, and introduces the woman and
 her career up to the time of her coronation as senior co-ruler
 with her nephew Thutmose III. Although there is a limit to
 the amount of text that can be included on gallery walls, the
 omission of any reference to the proscription of the queen
 in the sole reign of Thutmose III - such an important part
 of the story - seems odd, for this is one of the great riddles
 and well-known controversies in Egyptology. After the death
 of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III ordered that monuments show-
 ing her as king be effaced and recarved with the name of
 her father or husband, Thutmose I and II. Traditionally, it
 was assumed that these acts of damnatio memoriae took place
 when Thutmose came to the throne as sole king, and that
 they were in retribution for having to share the throne with
 Hatshepsut. However, over the last two decades, this issue has
 been examined, and the exhibition (and even more so the
 catalogue) is the perfect vehicle for making this recent and
 highly technical research accessible. The reinterpretation
 is based primarily on the research of the late Charles Nims
 and on the more recent work of Peter Dorman, who notes
 that the erasures were not undertaken early in the reign of
 Thutmose III but at least 20 years after Hatshepsut' s death,
 which implies a different motivation. Further, not all images
 of Hatshepsut were altered, only those that showed her as

 king. Although there does not seem to be a simple expla-
 nation for the actions of Thutmose III, Dorman cautiously
 suggests in a catalogue essay that the deliberate rewriting of
 history may have been either a response to the "conceptual
 and practical complications"4 of a female king (although she
 was not the first or the last female to claim the throne) or an
 attempt to eliminate references to the potentially competing
 Ahmoside line to the throne (but as Dorman further notes,
 there seems to have been no Ahmoside contender) . The
 introduction to the exhibition would have benefited from
 at least a hint of these issues.
 The introduction segues into the first gallery, which is
 devoted to the predecessors of Hatshepsut and the formative
 art of the time. Here, the visitor is introduced to the historic
 events of the Second Intermediate period and early New
 Kingdom (ca. 1650-1550 B.C.E.), with the expulsion of the
 Hyksos and the rise of the Ahmoside and Thutmoside lines.
 Objects from a woman's burial of the later Second Interme
diate period demonstrate the richness of elite tombs of the
 period immediately preceding Hatshepsut. The gallery also
 contains a wealth of early 18th-Dynasty sculpture, including
 the bust of a queen (cat. no. 8) ; the seated statue of Thutmose
 II's mother, Queen Mutnofret (cat. no. 9); and small-scale
 statues of men and women (cat. nos. 17-20). All of these
 give excellent background on the art of the era. Among
 the spectacular pieces is a limestone relief of Hatshepsut' s
 husband, Thutmose II, kneeling before the god Amun (cat.
 no. 38). This enormous relief (107 x 109 cm) from the
 Open Air Museum at Karnak is just one of the little-known
 masterpieces of Thutmoside sculpture.
 The next gallery has no text panel to identify its theme.
 Presumably it continues from the previous room, although
 the spaces are not the same color. The gallery is dominated
 by the famed sculpture of a very feminine representation
 of Hatshepsut (fig. 2) but one expressed in terms of male
 iconography. Unlike earlier statues that show her in this same
 pose wearing a female garment, her garb here is male (she
 wears the royal shendyt kilt with a bull's tail between her legs) .
 Yet the delicate proportions of her heart-shaped face and
 the subtle but obvious breasts mark the figure as a woman.
 This same ambiguity is evident in the texts on the front of
 the throne that simply add feminine endings to male kingly
 titles, employing "Lady of the Two Lands" for the traditional
 "Lord of the Two Lands." A final assertion of kingly power
 is represented by the Nine Bows, the traditional enemies of
 Egypt, under her feet - a detail that was not included in her
 images as queen. Other objects include a handsome chair
 of Renisenb (cat. no. 192), a block statue (cat. no. 53) of

 2006] HATSHEPSUT AND HER WORLD 651
 Satepihu on loan from the University of Pennsylvania, and
 other small objects from early in Hatshepsut's era. Visitors
 with little background in the history of the 18th Dynasty
 might be puzzled by the label for the fine shawabti of Puy
emre (cat. no. 51), which refers to hacking out the name of
 Hatshepsut in the reign of Thutmose III, because this issue
 is not mentioned earlier. The same minor discontinuity is
 apparent on the label for the statue of Senenmut (cat. no.
 64) , which refers to the proscription of his memory.
 The subsequent gallery discusses Hatshepsut's rise to
 kingly status as a legitimate ruler and her reign in an era
 of prosperity, peace, and creativity. Objects reflect mainly
 daily life: two metal jars on stands (cat. nos. 177-78), pot-
 tery vessels in the form of baskets (cat. nos. 157-59) , a small,
 multicompartmentbox (cat. no. 187) (fig. 3), and a linen sto-
 rage chest of Perpauti (cat. no. 25) painted with scenes of him
 with his family. There are some fascinating objects in this
 gallery, such as a section of the Book of the Dead of Maiher
peri (cat. no. 35) . A Nubian nobleman raised in the Egyptian
 court, Maiherperi was buried in the Valley of the Kings. A
 highlight of the gallery is the spectacular gold dish of General
 Djehuti (cat. no. 176).
 The next gallery, painted a dramatic dark blue, is dedicated
 to the family and career of Senenmut, "The Great Steward of
 Amun" and tutor to Neferure, Hatshepsut's daughter. Upon
 entering, one sees material from the tomb of Senenmut' s
 parents, Hatnefer and Ramose. The Metropolitan Museum's
 discovery of the tomb in 1936 is a fascinating story related in
 the wall text. The objects include Hatnefer' s chair (cat. no.
 47) (fig. 4) and heart scarab (cat. no. 41 ) , which was certainly
 a royal gift, judging from its exquisite quality (even though it
 was reinscribed for Hatnefer) . Other touching personal items
 such as a razor and cosmetic containers are also exhibited.
 Senenmut's role in the reign of Hatshepsut and the na-
 ture of his relationship with her have long been debated. In
 popular accounts, Senenmut is rumored to be the female
 pharaoh's lover, or at least a palace schemer and manipula-
 tor, and an evil genius who was behind Hatshepsut's rise to
 power. This historical fantasy is not addressed in the exhibi
tion, but it is eloquently discussed by Keller in the catalogue
 essay, "Hatshepsut's Reputation in History." The scholarly
 uncertainty concerning the exact role that he played in the
 conception of the royal temple at Deir el-Bahri is reflected
 in both the show and the catalogue. The text panels state, "It
 may also have been Senenmut who conceived Hatshepsut's
 exquisite temple at Deir el-Bahri," and the catalogue notes,
 "it was he who provided the inspiration for this monument."5
 But elsewhere one reads, "The common claim that Senenmut
 was the architect of Deir el-Bahri ... is otherwise unsubstanti-
 ated."6 What is clearer is the man's creativity and his access
 to the royal workshops, as demonstrated by the many statues
 of himself that he commissioned and that introduce entirely
 new compositional types: he holds the royal princess (cat. nos.
 60-1), he presents a sistrum (the monumental Cairo statue
 [cat. no. 66] specifically states that it was a royal gift) , he poses
 with his surveyor's cord (cat. no. 65). There are also statues
 that incorporate a cryptographic writing of Hatshepsut's
 name (cat. nos. 70-2 ). In the inscription on one statue,
 Fig. 2. Hatshepsut as king, early 18th Dynasty, crystalline
 (indurated) limestone (courtesy Metropolitan Museum of
 Art, New York; Rogers Fund 1929, 29.3.2).
 Senenmut boasts that the sculptures represent "Images which
 I have made from the devising of my own heart and from
 my own labor; they have not been found in the writings of
 the ancestors."
 The assembling of virtually all the known statues of
 Senenmut in one gallery is reason enough to see and love
 this exhibition. As a bonus, the conservators in New York
 have cleaned decades of Cairo grime off the monumental
 statue, exposing its beautiful color. The wall text here finally
 addresses the issue of the effacing of his name that has
 spawned so many dramatic historical reconstructions of this
 era. The grouping of Senenmut statues also gives the viewer
 the rare opportunity to compare sculptural representations of
 a single individual executed over a short time span. One may
 note variations in the shape of Senenmut's face: the larger
 statues are generally broader through the cheekbones than
 the smaller examples. Other variables are the style of the
 wig and the presence or absence of fat rolls on an otherwise
 slender body, an indication of exalted status rather than actual
 body type. Such elements are due to the symbolic nature of
 Egyptian art. These are not portraits of the man but eternal

 images intended to convey information about his status and
 his relationship to the royal family.
 The following room, in a less intense mood, details the
 famed funerary temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri and
 how it relates to royal ritual and popular cult activities. The
 text also explains how the design of Deir el-Bahri is derived
 from the nearby temple of Mentuhotep II (the founder of
 the Middle Kingdom). Through emulation of architectural
 styles, Hatshepsut sought to reinforce her own position as
 king. A kneeling statue of Hatshepsut as king (cat. no. 93) is
 illustrative of the many statues that flanked the processional
 way (this example is from the middle terrace). The gallery
 also contains a selection of one of the royal foundation
 deposits (consisting of scarabs, beads, amulets, and model
 tools [cat. nos. 75-7] ) that established the identity of the
 ruler who commissioned the structure. The relevance of the
 temple for the local elite is indicated by objects from a tomb
 of a woman who was buried at the base of the cliffs near the
 temple, as well as by objects from a nearby funeral deposit.
 Beautiful items, such as a group of blue faience "marsh
 bowls" (cat. nos. 101-5), many of which were votive offerings
 to Hathor of Deir el-Bahri, are presented. The connection
 of the selection of figure vases (cat. nos. 161-68), the relief
 from Elephantine (cat. no. 49) showing the goddess Anukis,
 and a fragment of a Karnak obelisk (cat. no. 78) to the site
 of Deir el-Bahri is not immediately apparent.
 The following gallery is dominated by three great sphinxes:
 two of Hatshepsut and one of a queen of Thutmose III (cat.
 nos. 11, 88-9). The labels underscore the irony that those
 of Hatshepsut were preserved through their destruction;
 the pieces were later recovered for reconstruction by the
 Metropolitan Museum.
 Gallery 6 addresses the relationship between Hatshepsut
 and her father, Thutmose I. She claimed the right to the
 throne through him, a succession that was justified by an
 oracle and furthered by her claim to be descended from
 Amun. One aspect of the story is told by the great granite
 false door of Thutmose I (cat. no. 87) from the upper terrace
 of Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri. It is displayed in a
 recess that imitates the chapel in which it was found. In the
 recess for Hatshepsut's image is a granite statue of the female
 king (wearing female garb and no false beard [cat. no. 61 ] ) ,
 which may have been the focus of cult worship at the temple.
 Opposite are reliefs of Thutmose I (with splendid carving
 and pigment [cat. no. 83]); one of Hatshepsut recarved as
 Thutmose II, presumably upon the order of Thutmose III
 (cat. no. 84); and one of Thutmose III (cat. no. 85), which
 neatly summarizes the relationship of these individuals.
 Gallery 7 focuses on the foreign wives of Thutmose III and
 the material from their shared tomb, as well as other examples
 of contemporary jewelry not associated with that find. Most
 stunning is the well-known diadem with gazelles (cat. no.
 113), which, according to the label and catalogue, was worn
 by a woman who participated in rituals associated with the
 goddess Hathor. It is not clear why the statue of Hatshepsut
 presenting a nemset vessel (cat. no. 91) is located in this gal-
 lery, or how the headrest (cat. no. 190) and the fittings from
 a bed (cat. no. 191) relate to the theme of this section. The
 wall text that explains the theme of the gallery is a little too
 inconspicuous and therefore easily overlooked.
 The small Gallery 8 is painted an appealing blue. The
 text describes the transition from Hatshepsut's original cliff
 tomb to her final tomb in the Valley of the Kings (to show
 her kingly status) . The gallery is dominated by the granite
 sarcophagus of Hatshepsut recarved for Thutmose I (cat.
 no. 108) and small objects associated with the tomb, such as
 two alabaster jars (cat. no. 106) probably originally intended
 for the royal tomb but recovered with the material from the
 foreign wives. Objects with a purely funerary function (gold
 sandals and finger and toe stalls [cat. nos. 134, 135a-b] are
 also shown). The association with the tomb of a beautiful
 jasper gaming piece in the form of a lion's head (cat. no.
 107) is not explained on the label or in the catalogue. A map
 showing the location of the tomb and/or a plan of the tomb
 would have helped place the artifacts in context.
 The final gallery is devoted to the successful reign of
 Thutmose III and the debt he owed to the tutelage of
 Hatshepsut. Yet later in his reign, he chose to attack monu
ments that perpetuated her memory. Physical attacks were
 not limited to her own monuments but also included those
 around her, as documented by the statue of the official,
 Ahmose (cat. no. 198) , whose inscriptions have been altered
 (the name Thutmose I or II was substituted for the name
 of the female pharaoh). A large case heaped with smashed
 pieces of Hatshepsut's statues (not listed in the catalogue)
 is a vivid illustration of the destruction of her monuments.
 It is an intriguing jumble of painted and carved fragments,
 some of which can be identified as parts of an ear, nose, or
 crown. The large-format photographs of the Metropolitan
 Museum's excavation of the fragments at Deir el-Bahri evoke
 the scale and difficulties of the work and the fury of the
 ancient destruction.
 This is an excellent and comprehensive exhibition. Few
 of the major monuments from the era, large or small, are
 omitted. The spacing of the cases is generous, and most
 objects can be viewed in the round. A significant number
 of the large sculptures and reliefs are not in cases, which
 allows uncompromised viewing. The lighting (by Clint Ross
 Coller and Rich Lichte) is arranged well. The viewer casts
 no irritating shadows on the labels or cases. The designer,
 Daniel Kershaw, has restrained himself tojust two wall colors,
 gray and blue, that effectively mark the transition between
 galleries without creating a jarring contrast.

 Hatshepsut: From Queen to Pharaoh is presented as an art
 and archaeological exhibition, and without the excellent
 catalogue in hand, most visitors may not be aware of the
 tremendous amount of new scholarship that the show re-
 flects. Among the topics addressed in the catalogue's short
 essays are new perspectives on the relationship of Hatshepsut
 and Senenmut, the monuments of Hatshepsut, and, most
 importantly, a new and less hysterical reading of the rela-
 tionship of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. Some notable
 sections discuss the temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahri
 (written by Jadwiga Lipinska, who oversaw their excava
tion), the queen's complex (by Dieter Arnold, a prominent
 architectural historian, Egyptologist, and curator in the
 Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian department) , the statuary
 of Hatshepsut and Senenmut (by Keller), and the proscrip-
 tion of Hatshepsut (by Dorman). The catalogue distills this
 highly academic and technical research for a more general
 audience, making it an important new resource for early
 18th-Dynasty history and art.
 This is an ambitious, exhaustive, and exhilarating exhibi-
 tion that will have wide appeal - from die-hard fans of Egypt
 to those who simply love beautiful antiquities and are not so
 concerned with the historical issues. It is difficult to imagine
 that this amount of material pertaining to Hatshepsut and her
 contemporaries will ever again be compiled. The catalogue
 is an important piece of scholarship that will do much to
 remove many of the colorful misconceptions of the era.
