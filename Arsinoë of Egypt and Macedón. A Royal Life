C.'s new biography of the formidable Arsinoë II in Oxford's Women in Antiquity series
adds to new, focused studies on Hellenistic queens, along with D. Roller's portrait of
Cleopatra VII and D. dayman's newly-published Berenice II. The aim of these mono-
graphs is to offer 'compact and accessible' introductions to notable women from antiquity.
C., author of Women and Monarchy in Ancient Macedonia (2000) and numerous other
studies on Hellenistic royal women and courts, is well suited to take on this figure
whose career spanned the formative years of the early-Hellenistic Macedonian and
Ptolemaic courts. The result is a very useful compilation of the sources and bibliography
on Arsinoë and a clear and judicious overview of this important figure.
After a brief introduction, a chapter on Arsinoë' s background and youth is followed by
two chapters on her ill-fated marriages in Thrace and Macedonia, first to Lysimachus and
then to her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos. Chapters 4 and 5 treat Arsinoë' s marriage to
her brother Ptolemy Philadelphus. A final chapter is dedicated to Arsinoë's 'afterlife'.
An appendix appraises the extant literary sources and provides an overview of secondary
scholarship.
The source material for Arsinoë's life is difficult and very fragmentary, and some of the
methodological observations of the thorough appendix would have been better placed at
the front of the book. The main historical source, Justin's Epitome of Pompeius Trogus,
is very late and internally inconsistent, and the rest of the scattered literary sources only
allow us to sketch her life in the broadest outline. As C. rightly notes, this problem has
led to vastly different interpretations of her character and role in the politics of the
Macedonian and Ptolemaic courts. These range from Bevan's memorable 'tigress', followed
in large part by early authorities like Tarn and Macurdy, to S. Burstein' s important
reassessment
('Arsinoé II Philadelphos: a Revisionist View' in Philip II, Alexander the
Great
and the Macedonian Heritage [1982]) that challenged this portrait and the notion
that
Ptolemy II was an ineffectual puppet, and subsequent studies further reducing her
role in politics. As such, understanding the limitations of the sources is essential for mounting
a convincing reconstruction of Arsinoë. The reason this material is relegated to the
book's sole appendix, I imagine, is to increase the text's accessibility as an introductory
biography. This raises the crucial question of the intended audience of the book and the
feasibility of writing a 'biography' in the modern sense of a figure so poorly known.
The book is admirably approachable, but still assumes enough background that it is not
exactly for a 'general audience'. In particular undergraduates would certainly benefit
from greater insight into the methodology of ancient history.
A particular strength of C.'s treatment is a focus on Arsinoë's circle of philoi and partisans.
C. helps the reader vividly imagine the world of the Macedonian court, riven by
factionalism
between rival wives and potential heirs, and their supporters. C. emphasises
this background and employs it to address some of the lacunae of the sources.
However, periodic, but too frequent, speculations such as '[Arsinoë] could have been a
controlled, even repressed young woman thanks to the tense situation in which she had
grown up' (p. 32) detract from what is otherwise a main point of the book - that our cultural
categories are not those of the ancients and we should not impose them on our

interpretation of royal women. Similarly hypothetical suggestions, such as the notion that
Arsinoë II may have actually 'brought up' (p. 68) Arsinoë I after the death of the latter' s
mother, not only lack any evidentiary basis, but can give the reader a false impression - in
this case that the royal Macedonian family was in some way similar to the modern nuclear
family.
One chapter of Arsinoë' s life in Macedonia that is more fully treated by the ancient
sources is her role in the execution of Lysimachus' son Agathocles and her marriage to
Ptolemy Keraunos. Here the sources are unsatisfactory, and C. ably shows how they
play on topoi of female behaviour. Regarding the murder of Agathocles, C. does plausibly
emphasise the importance of the arrival of Ptolemy Keraunos and the acquisition of
Macedonia as destabilising factors but ultimately resorts to a psychologising interpretation
of the sequence of events, stressing Arsinoë's fear for her own sons (pp. 42-3). The question
of agency remains obscure in C.'s account, and it does not explain Lysimachus' decision
to eliminate his son, a risky move that ultimately undermined his house. Dmitriev's
suggestion
that the elevation of Ptolemy II and the sudden rise in prestige of Arsinoë
and
her line were the motivating factors perhaps deserves fuller consideration ('The Last
Marriage
and the Death of Lysimachus' GRBS 47 [2007]).
The remainder of the book deals with Arsinoë's career in Egypt. As C. herself states,
her emphasis lies more on the Macedonian background than the Egyptian dimension of
Ptolemaic kingship. Due to the difficulty of the material, a more comprehensive guide
to the complex literature on the Egyptian 'face' of the Ptolemaic monarchy would be help-
ful. Arsinoë of course stands at the centre of the intractable issue of brother-sister marriage
in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt. C.'s treatment of this issue belongs to the school that minimises
the scale of Greek discomfort with this practice (p. 74). She also downplays the role
of
Egyptian precedent and suggests the preference for extreme endogamy was a response to
the
problems of polygamy, an inwardness already signalled by Ptolemy I (pp. 76-7) and
prefigured
by her marriage to her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos (pp. 58-64). Neither
proposition
is fully convincing. Sibling marriage has been a topic of perennial interest,
but
it has recently been the subject of renewed scholarly attention and extremely divergent
opinion.
C. takes full account of the new literature in her bibliography, but does not offer
the
reader a systematic appraisal of the evidence and various scholarly arguments, thereby
giving
little indication of why she favours her interpretation. There is also a tendency
towards
somewhat circular argumentation that crops up elsewhere in the text - sibling marriage
would become a hallmark of the Ptolemaic dynasty so this explains Ptolemy's gamble.
This itself is overstated. The next sibling marriage was two generations later in 221 and
thereafter it was still only sporadic.
C. provides a sensitive overview of the difficult question of Arsinoë's political influ-
ence as queen. However, as the only contemporary literary sources, the discussion of
the works of the Alexandrian poets as reflection of Ptolemaic imperial discourse is surprisingly
brief. On the subject of Arsinoë's death and cult, the new publication of P. Sorb. 71
(Cadell
et al., Papyrus de la Sorbonne (P. Sorb. III nos 70-144) [201 1]) adds detail, demonstrating
that Arsinoë died between 27 June and 26 July 270 and not in 268, that the
appointment
of a kanephoros for Arsinoë's cult began already in 269 and finally that
Ptolemy
'the Son' became co-regent with Ptolemy II earlier than is usually assumed,
i.e. in 268/7 rather than 267/6.
Most of the discussion of the material culture relating to Arsinoë (coinage, portraiture,
cult) is relegated to the final chapter on her 'afterlife'. Despite the fact that much of this
was or may have been posthumous, it still represents the largest contemporary or nearcontemporary
body of primary evidence on Arsinoë and her role in the formative period
of
Ptolemaic self-representation and might have been more effectively incorporated into

the previous chapters. The question of the image of Arsinoë and its long-lived importance
to the Ptolemaic monarchy is complex, and again non-specialist readers would benefit from
a fuller discussion of the issues and more complete footnotes. Fuliñska's recent treatment
of the iconography of the Ptolemaic queens on coinage can be added to C.'s bibliography
( Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization 14 [2010]) along with Albersmeier's study of the
portrait statues of the Ptolemaic queens ( Untersuchungen zu den Frauenstatuen des
ptolemäischen Ägypten [2002]). Finally, a more substantial conclusion would have been
a valuable asset.
Despite these concerns, this is a valuable book. Arsinoë has long merited an accessible
monographic treatment in English, and this balanced study is a good starting point for anyone
interested in the Hellenistic royal families, the Macedonian and Ptolemaic courts, or
women
in antiquity in general. It is an important addition to a much-needed series.

B. continues his contribution to the study of Egyptian religion in this new work. Differing
from previous studies, the book examines the main topics concerning the cult of Isis,
accessible by those without an extensive background in Isis studies. Similar in some
respects to B.'s previously published Bibliotheca Isiaca I (2008), much of the work is
devoted to the study of material culture, relying extensively on examples from his
Recueil des inscriptions concernant les cultes isiaques (RICIS), published in 2005.
The title does not indicate the study's true range, which is not only devoted to the worship
of Isis but incorporates other deities included within her pantheon, such as Osiris. The
book
proceeds along broad thematic lines: Part 1 offers a cursory overview of Isis' divine
pantheon;
Part 2 the cult's diffusion; Part 3 issues of the cult's reception and integration;
Part
4 cult places; Part 5 cultic participants; Part 6 rites and practices of the cult; and Part 7
the
many terms and iconography associated with the cult. Each section consists of multiple
subsections
including a page-long introduction into the topic followed by select examples
drawn
from literary, epigraphic and archaeological sources and concluding bibliographical
suggestions.
In the introduction, B. outlines a selective historiography of previous Isis research,
which is especially helpful in illustrating how such studies have guided past interpretations
of the cult and provides the foundation for the topics addressed in his book. Part 1 begins
with a brief examination of the main components of Isis' divine pantheon. B. evaluates the
literary and iconographie image of Isis as well as the origins of Serapis (pp. 31-41). The
primary deities associated with Isis including Harpocrate, Anubis, Apis, Boubastis and
Osiris are examined in combination with limited literary, epigraphic and archaeological
examples. While not overly extensive, the examples given provide a general account of
the cult and a starting point for any future study.
The long second part examines the cult's diffusion, a topic with a considerable amount
of surviving material evidence. Proceeding beyond the diffusion of Isis, B. also considers
